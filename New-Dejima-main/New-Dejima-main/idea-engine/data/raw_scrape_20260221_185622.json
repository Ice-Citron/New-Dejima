      "body": "The book page links to a blog post that explains how I got about it (and \nhas a link to sample content), but the TL&amp;DR is that I could not find \na lot of books that were on &quot;our&quot; history _and_ were larded with technical \ndetails. So I set about writing one, and some five years later I&#x27;m happy \nto share the result. I think it&#x27;s one of the few &quot;computer history&quot; books that has tons of code, but correct me if I&#x27;m wrong (I wrote this both to tell a story and to learn :-)).<p>My favorite languages are Smalltalk and Lisp, but as an Emacs user, I&#x27;ve been \nusing the latter for much longer and for my current projects, Common Lisp is a better fit, so I call myself &quot;a Lisp-er&quot; these days. If people like what I did, \nI do have plans to write some more (but probably only after I retire, writing next to a full-time job is heard). Maybe on Smalltalk, maybe on computer networks - two topics close to my heart.<p>And a shout-out to Dick Gabriel, he contributed some great personal memories about the man who started it all, John McCarthy.",

      "title": "Show HN: Artifact Keeper – Open-Source Artifactory/Nexus Alternative in Rust",
      "body": "I&#x27;m a software engineer who keeps getting pulled into DevOps no matter how hard I try to escape it. I recently moved into a Lead DevOps Engineer role writing tooling to automate a lot of the pain away. On my own time outside of work, I built Artifact Keeper — a self-hosted artifact registry that supports 45+ package formats. Security scanning, SSO, replication, WASM plugins — it&#x27;s all in the MIT-licensed release. No enterprise tier. No feature gates. No surprise invoices.<p>Your package managers — pip, npm, docker, cargo, helm, go, all of them — talk directly to it using their native protocols. Security scanning with Trivy, Grype, and OpenSCAP is built in, with a policy engine that can quarantine bad artifacts before they hit your builds. And if you need a format it doesn&#x27;t support yet, there&#x27;s a WASM plugin system so you can add your own without forking the backend.<p>Why I built it:<p>Part of what pulled me into computers in the first place was open source. I grew up poor in New Orleans, and the only hardware I had access to in the early 2000s were some Compaq Pentium IIs my dad brought home after his work was tossing them out. I put Linux on them, and it ran circles around Windows 2000 and Millennium on that low-end hardware. That experience taught me that the best software is software that&#x27;s open for everyone to see, use, and that actually runs well on whatever you&#x27;ve got.<p>Fast forward to today, and I see the same pattern everywhere: GitLab, JFrog, Harbor, and others ship a limited &quot;community&quot; edition and then hide the features teams actually need behind some paywall. I get it — paychecks have to come from somewhere. But I wanted to prove that a fully-featured artifact registry could exist as genuinely open-source software. Every feature. No exceptions.<p>The specific features came from real pain points. Artifactory&#x27;s search is painfully slow — that&#x27;s why I integrated Meilisearch. Security scanning that doesn&#x27;t require a separate enterprise license was another big one. And I wanted replication that didn&#x27;t need a central coordinator — so I built a peer mesh where any node can replicate to any other node. I haven&#x27;t deployed this at work yet — right now I&#x27;m running it at home for my personal projects — but I&#x27;d love to see it tested at scale, and that&#x27;s a big part of why I&#x27;m sharing it here.<p>The AI story (I&#x27;m going to be honest about this):<p>I built this in about three weeks using Claude Code. I know a lot of you will say this is probably vibe coding garbage — but if that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s an impressive pile of vibe coding garbage. Go look at the codebase. The backend is ~80% Rust with 429 unit tests, 33 PostgreSQL migrations, a layered architecture, and a full CI&#x2F;CD pipeline with E2E tests, stress testing, and failure injection.<p>AI didn&#x27;t make the design decisions for me. I still had to design the WASM plugin system, figure out how the scanning engines complement each other, and architect the mesh replication. Years of domain knowledge drove the design — AI just let me build it way faster. I&#x27;m floored at what these tools make possible for a tinkerer and security nerd like me.<p>Tech stack: Rust on Axum, PostgreSQL 16, Meilisearch, Trivy + Grype + OpenSCAP, Wasmtime WASM plugins (hot-reloadable), mesh replication with chunked transfers. Frontend is Next.js 15 plus native Swift (iOS&#x2F;macOS) and Kotlin (Android) apps. OpenAPI 3.1 spec with auto-generated TypeScript and Rust SDKs.<p>Try it:<p><pre><code>  git clone https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;artifact-keeper&#x2F;artifact-keeper.git\n  cd artifact-keeper\n  docker compose up -d\n</code></pre>\nThen visit http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:30080<p>Live demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.artifactkeeper.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.artifactkeeper.com</a>\nDocs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artifactkeeper.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artifactkeeper.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;d love any feedback — what you think of the approach, what you&#x27;d want to see, what you hate about Artifactory or Nexus that you wish someone would just fix.

      "body": "Hi HN! Smooth CLI (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smooth.sh\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smooth.sh</a>) is a browser that agents like Claude Code can use to navigate the web reliably, quickly, and affordably. It lets agents specify tasks using natural language, hiding UI complexity, and allowing them to focus on higher-level intents to carry out complex web tasks. It can also use your IP address while running browsers in the cloud, which helps a lot with roadblocks like captchas (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh&#x2F;features&#x2F;use-my-ip\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh&#x2F;features&#x2F;use-my-ip</a>).<p>Here’s a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=62jthcU705k\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=62jthcU705k</a>  Docs start at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh</a>.<p>Agents like Claude Code, etc are amazing but mostly restrained to the CLI, while a ton of valuable work needs a browser. This is a fundamental limitation to what these agents can do.<p>So far, attempts to add browsers to these agents (Claude’s built-in --chrome, Playwright MCP, agent-browser, etc.) all have interfaces that are unnatural for browsing. They expose hundreds of tools - e.g. click, type, select, etc - and the action space is too complex. (For an example, see the low-level details listed at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vercel-labs&#x2F;agent-browser\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vercel-labs&#x2F;agent-browser</a>). Also, they don’t handle the billion edge cases of the internet like iframes nested in iframes nested in shadow-doms and so on. The internet is super messy! Tools that rely on the accessibility tree, in particular, unfortunately do not work for a lot of websites.<p>We believe that these tools are at the wrong level of abstraction: they make the agent focus on UI details instead of the task to be accomplished.<p>Using a giant general-purpose model like Opus to click on buttons and fill out forms ends up being slow and expensive. The context window gets bogged down with details like clicks and keystrokes, and the model has to figure out how to do browser navigation each time. A smaller model in a system specifically designed for browsing can actually do this much better and at a fraction of the cost and latency.<p>Security matters too - probably more than people realize. When you run an agent on the web, you should treat it like an untrusted actor. It should access the web using a sandboxed machine and have minimal permissions by default. Virtual browsers are the perfect environment for that. There’s a good write up by Paul Kinlan that explains this very well (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aifoc.us&#x2F;the-browser-is-the-sandbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aifoc.us&#x2F;the-browser-is-the-sandbox</a> and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46762150\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=46762150</a>). Browsers were built to interact with untrusted software safely. They’re an isolation boundary that already works.<p>Smooth CLI is a browser designed for agents based on what they’re good at. We expose a higher-level interface to let the agent think in terms of goals and tasks, not low-level details.<p>For example, instead of this:<p><pre><code>  click(x=342, y=128)\n  type(&quot;search query&quot;)\n  click(x=401, y=130)\n  scroll(down=500)\n  click(x=220, y=340)\n  ...50 more steps\n</code></pre>\nYour agent just says:<p><pre><code>  Search for flights from NYC to LA and find the cheapest option\n</code></pre>\nAgents like Claude Code can use the Smooth CLI to extract hard-to-reach data, fill-in forms, download files, interact with dynamic content, handle authentication, vibe-test apps, and a lot more.<p>Smooth enables agents to launch as many browsers and tasks as they want, autonomously, and on-demand. If the agent is carrying out work on someone’s behalf, the agent’s browser presents itself to the web as a device on the user’s network. The need for this feature may diminish over time, but for now it’s a necessary primitive. To support this, Smooth offers a “self” proxy that creates a secure tunnel and routes all browser traffic through your machine’s IP address (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh&#x2F;features&#x2F;use-my-ip\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.smooth.sh&#x2F;features&#x2F;use-my-ip</a>). This is one of our favorite features because it makes the agent look like it’s running on your machine, while keeping all the benefits of running in the cloud.<p>We also take away as much security responsibility from the agent as possible. The agent should not be aware of authentication details or be responsible for handling malicious behavior such as prompt injections. While some security responsibility will always remain with the agent, the browser should minimize this burden as much as possible.<p>We’re biased of course, but in our tests, running Claude with Smooth CLI has been 20x faster and 5x cheaper than Claude Code with the --chrome flag (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smooth.sh&#x2F;images&#x2F;comparison.gif\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smooth.sh&#x2F;images&#x2F;comparison.gif</a>).

You deploy lightweight connectors that bridge to specific resources (private web apps, SSH, databases, CIDR ranges). Admins delegate resource-access to specific users and roles. It uses WireGuard with NAT hole-punching for peer-to-peer connections and traffic goes directly between the user and connector instead of through a central server. It supports native clients (Mac&#x2F;Windows&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;iOS&#x2F;Android) plus identity-aware, browser-based access when a client isn’t required.<p>Pangolin has a cloud and is optionally self-hosted. The Community Edition is AGPLv3. The Enterprise Edition is also open-source under the commercial license which enables free personal&#x2F;small business use.<p>Everything, from the server to the clients, is fully open-source and you can even self-host the whole stack.

      "title": "Show HN: CodeRLM – Tree-sitter-backed code indexing for LLM agents",
      "body": "I&#x27;ve been building a tool that changes how LLM coding agents explore codebases, and I wanted to share it along with some early observations.<p>Typically claude code globs directories, greps for patterns, and reads files with minimal guidance. It works in kind of the same way you&#x27;d learn to navigate a city by walking every street. You&#x27;ll eventually build a mental map, but claude never does - at least not any that persists across different contexts.<p>The Recursive Language Models paper from Zhang, Kraska, and Khattab at MIT CSAIL introduced a cleaner framing. Instead of cramming everything into context, the model gets a searchable environment. The model can then query just for what it needs and can drill deeper where needed.<p>coderlm is my implementation of that idea for codebases. A Rust server indexes a project with tree-sitter, builds a symbol table with cross-references, and exposes an API. The agent queries for structure, symbols, implementations, callers, and grep results — getting back exactly the code it needs instead of scanning for it.<p>The agent workflow looks like:<p>1. `init` — register the project, get the top-level structure<p>2. `structure` — drill into specific directories<p>3. `search` — find symbols by name across the codebase<p>4. `impl` — retrieve the exact source of a function or class<p>5. `callers` — find everything that calls a given symbol<p>6. `grep` — fall back to text search when you need it<p>This replaces the glob&#x2F;grep&#x2F;read cycle with index-backed lookups. The server currently supports Rust, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Go for symbol parsing, though all file types show up in the tree and are searchable via grep.<p>It ships as a Claude Code plugin with hooks that guide the agent to use indexed lookups instead of native file tools, plus a Python CLI wrapper with zero dependencies.<p>For anecdotal results, I ran the same prompt against a codebase to &quot;explore and identify opportunities to clarify the existing structure&quot;.<p>Using coderlm, claude was able to generate a plan in about 3 minutes. The coderlm enabled instance found a genuine bug (duplicated code with identical names), orphaned code for cleanup, mismatched naming conventions crossing module boundaries, and overlapping vocabulary. These are all <i>semantic</i> issues which clearly benefit from the tree-sitter centric approach.<p>Using the native tools, claude was able to identify various file clutter in the root of the project, out of date references, and a migration timestamp collision. These findings are more consistent with methodical walks of the filesystem and took about 8 minutes to produce.<p>The indexed approach did better at catching semantic issues than native tools and had a key benefit in being faster to resolve.<p>I&#x27;ve spent some effort to streamline the installation process, but it isn&#x27;t turnkey yet. You&#x27;ll need the rust toolchain to build the server which runs as a separate process. Installing the plugin from a claude marketplace is possible, but the skill isn&#x27;t being added to your .claude yet so there are some manual steps to just getting to a point where claude could use it.<p>Claude continues to demonstrate significant resistance to using CodeRLM in exploration tasks. Typically to use you will need to explicitly direct claude to use it.<p>---<p>Repo: github.com&#x2F;JaredStewart&#x2F;coderlm<p>Paper: Recursive Language Models <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2512.24601\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2512.24601</a> — Zhang, Kraska, Khattab (MIT CSAIL, 2025)<p>Inspired by: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brainqub3&#x2F;claude_code_RLM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brainqub3&#x2F;claude_code_RLM</a>",

      "body": "Hi all, Aram and Eduard here - co-founders of Modelence (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelence.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelence.com</a>). After spending years on scaling our previous startup’s platform, we built an open-source full-stack TypeScript + MongoDB framework to stop solving the same auth &#x2F; database &#x2F; API &#x2F; cron job implementations every time we created an app, and we didn’t like the idea of using multiple managed platforms for each of these to run our apps either.<p>(Here’s our prior Show HN post for reference: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44902227\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44902227</a>)<p>At the same time, we were excited by the whole AI app builder boom and realized that the real challenge there is the platform rather than the tool itself. Now we’re making Modelence the first full-stack framework that’s built for coding agents and humans alike:<p>- TypeScript is already great for AI coding because it provides guardrails and catches many errors at build time, so agents can auto-correct<p>- MongoDB eliminates the schema management problem for agents, which is where they fail the most often otherwise (+ works great with TS&#x2F;Node.js)<p>- Built-in auth, database, cron jobs and else that just works together out of the box means agents only focus on your product logic and don’t fail at trying to set these things up (+ less tokens spent on boilerplate).<p>You can now try the Modelence app builder (based on Claude Agent SDK) by just typing a prompt on our landing page ( <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelence.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;modelence.com</a> ) - watch a demo video here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BPsYvj_nGuE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;BPsYvj_nGuE</a><p>Then you can check it out locally and continue working in your own IDE, while still using Modelence Cloud as your backend, with a dev cloud environment, and later deploy and run on Modelence Cloud with built-in observability around every operation running in your app.<p>We’re also going to add a built-in DevOps agent that lives in the same cloud, knows the framework end-to-end, and will use all this observability data to act on errors, alerts, and incidents - closing the loop, because running in production is much harder than just building.<p>We launched the app builder as a quick start for developers, to demonstrate the framework and Modelence Cloud without having to manually read docs and follow the steps to set up a new app. Our main focus is still the platform itself, since we believe the real challenge in AI coding is the framework and the platform rather than the builder tool itself.",

      "body": "Hey HN, stripe-no-webhooks is an open-source library that syncs your Stripe payments data to your own Postgres database:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pretzelai&#x2F;stripe-no-webhooks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pretzelai&#x2F;stripe-no-webhooks</a>.<p>Here&#x27;s a demo video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cyEgW7wElcs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cyEgW7wElcs</a><p>Why is this useful? (1) You don&#x27;t have to figure out which webhooks you need or write listeners for each one. The library handles all of that. This follows the approach of libraries like dj-stripe in the Django world (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dj-stripe.dev&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dj-stripe.dev&#x2F;</a>). (2) Stripe&#x27;s API has a 100 rpm rate limit. If you&#x27;re checking subscription status frequently or building internal tools, you&#x27;ll hit it. Querying your own Postgres doesn&#x27;t have this problem. (3) You can give an AI agent read access to the stripe.* schema to debug payment issues—failed charges, refunds, whatever—without handing over Stripe dashboard access. (4) You can join Stripe data with your own tables for custom analytics, LTV calculations, etc.<p>It creates a webhook endpoint in your Stripe account to forward webhooks to your backend where a webhook listener stores all the data into a new <i>stripe.*</i> schema. You define your plans in TypeScript, run a sync command, and the library takes care of creating Stripe products and prices, handling webhooks, and keeping your database in sync. We also let you backfill your Stripe data for existing accounts.<p>It supports pre-paid usage credits, account wallets and usage-based billing. It also lets you generate a pricing table component that you can customize. You can access the user information using the simple API the library provides:<p><pre><code>  billing.subscriptions.get({ userId });\n  billing.credits.consume({ userId, key: &quot;api_calls&quot;, amount: 1 });\n  billing.usage.record({ userId, key: &quot;ai_model_tokens_input&quot;, amount: 4726 });\n</code></pre>\nEffectively, you don&#x27;t have to deal with either the Stripe dashboard or the Stripe API&#x2F;SDK any more if you don&#x27;t want to. The library gives you a nice abstraction on top of Stripe that should cover ~most subscription payment use-cases.<p>Let&#x27;s see how it works with a quick example. Say you have a billing plan like Cursor (the IDE) used to have: $20&#x2F;mo, you get 500 API completions + 2000 tab completions, you can buy additional API credits, and any additional usage is billed as overage.<p>You define your plan in TypeScript:<p><pre><code>  {\n    name: &quot;Pro&quot;,\n    description: &quot;Cursor Pro plan&quot;,\n    price: [{ amount: 2000, currency: &quot;usd&quot;, interval: &quot;month&quot; }],\n    features: {\n      api_completion: {\n        pricePerCredit: 1,              &#x2F;&#x2F; 1 cent per unit\n        trackUsage: true,               &#x2F;&#x2F; Enable usage billing\n        credits: { allocation: 500 },\n        displayName: &quot;API Completions&quot;,\n      },\n      tab_completion: {\n        credits: { allocation: 2000 },\n        displayName: &quot;Tab Completions&quot;,\n      },\n    },\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThen on the CLI, you run the `init` command which creates the DB tables + some API handlers. Run `sync` to sync the plans to your Stripe account and create a webhook endpoint. When a subscription is created, the library automatically grants the 500 API completion credits and 2000 tab completion credits to the user. Renewals and up&#x2F;downgrades are handled sanely.<p>Consume code would look like this:<p><pre><code>  await billing.credits.consume({\n    userId: user.id,\n    key: &quot;api_completion&quot;,\n    amount: 1,\n  });\n</code></pre>\nAnd if they want to allow manual top-ups by the user:<p><pre><code>  await billing.credits.topUp({\n    userId: user.id,\n    key: &quot;api_completion&quot;,\n    amount: 500,     &#x2F;&#x2F; buy 500 credits, charges $5.00\n  });\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly, we have APIs for wallets and usage.<p>This would be a lot of work to implement by yourself on top of Stripe. You need to keep track of all of these entitlements in your own DB and deal with renewals, expiry, ad-hoc grants, etc. It&#x27;s definitely doable, especially with AI coding, but you&#x27;ll probably end up building something fragile and hard to maintain.<p>This is just a high-level overview of what the library is capable of. It also supports seat-level credits, monetary wallets (with micro-cent precision), auto top-ups, robust failure recovery, tax collection, invoices, and an out-of-the-box pricing table.<p>I vibe-coded a little toy app for testing: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snw-test.vercel.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snw-test.vercel.app</a>. There&#x27;s no validation so feel free to sign up with a dummy email, then subscribe to a plan with a test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242, any future expiry, any 3-digit CVV.<p>Screenshot: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;demo-screenshot-Rh6Ucqx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;demo-screenshot-Rh6Ucqx</a><p>Feel free to try it out!

      "body": "Hey! I&#x27;m eshaan and I&#x27;m building Ourguide -an on-screen task guidance system that can show you where to click step-by-step when you need help.<p>I started building this because whenever I didn’t know how to do something on my computer, I found myself constantly tabbing between chatbots and the app, pasting screenshots, and asking “what do I do next?” Ourguide solves this with two modes. In Guide mode, the app overlays your screen and highlights the specific element to click next, eliminating the need to leave your current window. There is also Ask mode, which is a vision-integrated chat that captures your screen context—which you can toggle on and off anytime -so you can ask, &quot;How do I fix this error?&quot; without having to explain what &quot;this&quot; is.<p>It’s an Electron app that works OS-wide, is vision-based, and isn&#x27;t restricted to the browser.<p>Figuring out how to show the user where to click was the hardest part of the process. I originally trained a computer vision model with 2300 screenshots to identify and segment all UI elements on a screen and used a VLM to find the correct icon to highlight. While this worked extremely well—better than SOTA grounding models like UI Tars—the latency was just too high. I&#x27;ll be making that CV+VLM pipeline OSS soon, but for now, I’ve resorted to a simpler implementation that achieves &lt;1s latency.<p>You may ask: if I can show you where to click, why can&#x27;t I just click too? While trying to build computer-use agents during my job in Palo Alto, I hit the core limitation of today’s computer-use models where benchmarks hover in the mid-50% range (OSWorld). VLMs often know what to do but not what it looks like; without reliable visual grounding, agents misclick and stall. So, I built computer use—without the &quot;use.&quot; It provides the visual grounding of an agent but keeps the human in the loop for the actual execution to prevent misclicks.<p>I personally use it for the AWS Console&#x27;s &quot;treasure hunt&quot; UI, like creating a public S3 bucket with specific CORS rules. It’s also been surprisingly helpful for non-technical tasks, like navigating obscure settings in Gradescope or Spotify. Ourguide really works for any task when you’re stuck or don&#x27;t know what to do.<p>You can download and test Ourguide here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourguide.ai&#x2F;downloads\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourguide.ai&#x2F;downloads</a><p>The project is still very early, and I’d love your feedback on where it fails, where you think it worked well, and which specific niches you think Ourguide would be most helpful for.",

A fast and friendly VM management TUI written in Rust. You can create, configure, organize, and manage VMs directly with QEMU. No libvert. No XML. No wonky UI&#x27;s.

No jumping through hoops to get GPU passthrough working!<p>(Disclaimer: This works great with other guest Linux VMs, but is not suitable for Windows gaming. If you want to game on Windows within a VM, passthrough is a must. vm-curator will have fast and friendly support soon.)<p>Looking for contributors (especially to help with the ascii art,) and donations are welcome.

Hence the name of the website.<p>The site is hosted on Cloudflare pages and I use Github actions to trigger a python script that fetches and checks the prices. It runs twice a day. If the script encounters any new ASINs, it stores them for future checks, so the list of golf balls being price checked should keep growing over time. Changes are then pushed to Cloudflare pages.<p>There can sometimes be some pricing oddities when the product title says one count, but the unit count being returned from Amazon is another number, so I&#x27;m trying to add some checks to help accommodate for that. Right now, I just have some manual overrides for certain ASINs, but I&#x27;m looking to improve on it in the future.<p>The frontend is just some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<p>Listings on Amazon can be inconsistent sometimes because, for example, product titles will say used balls, but the seller lists them as new.

      "body": "I&#x27;ve been a webfiction reader for years (too many hours on Royal Road), and I kept running into the same question: which LLMs actually write fiction that people want to keep reading? That&#x27;s why I built Narrator (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrator.sh&#x2F;llm-leaderboard\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrator.sh&#x2F;llm-leaderboard</a>) – a platform where LLMs generate serialized fiction and get ranked by real reader engagement.<p>Turns out this is surprisingly hard to answer. Creative writing isn&#x27;t a single capability – it&#x27;s a pipeline: brainstorming → writing → memory. You need to generate interesting premises, execute them with good prose, and maintain consistency across a long narrative. Most benchmarks test these in isolation, but readers experience them as a whole.<p>The current evaluation landscape is fragmented:\nMemory benchmarks like FictionLive&#x27;s tests use MCQs to check if models remember plot details across long contexts. Useful, but memory is necessary for good fiction, not sufficient. A model can ace recall and still write boring stories.<p>Author-side usage data from tools like Novelcrafter shows which models writers prefer as copilots. But that measures what&#x27;s useful for human-AI collaboration, not what produces engaging standalone output. Authors and readers have different needs.<p>LLM-as-a-judge is the most common approach for prose quality, but it&#x27;s notoriously unreliable for creative work. Models have systematic biases (favoring verbose prose, certain structures), and &quot;good writing&quot; is genuinely subjective in ways that &quot;correct code&quot; isn&#x27;t.<p>What&#x27;s missing is a reader-side quantitative benchmark – something that measures whether real humans actually enjoy reading what these models produce. That&#x27;s the gap Narrator fills: views, time spent reading, ratings, bookmarks, comments, return visits. Think of it as an &quot;AI Wattpad&quot; where the models are the authors.<p>I shared an early DSPy-based version here 5 months ago (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44903265\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44903265</a>). The big lesson: one-shot generation doesn&#x27;t work for long-form fiction. Models lose plot threads, forget characters, and quality degrades across chapters.<p>The rewrite: from one-shot to a persistent agent loop<p>The current version runs each model through a writing harness that maintains state across chapters. Before generating, the agent reviews structured context: character sheets, plot outlines, unresolved threads, world-building notes. After generating, it updates these artifacts for the next chapter. Essentially each model gets a &quot;writer&#x27;s notebook&quot; that persists across the whole story.<p>This made a measurable difference – models that struggled with consistency in the one-shot version improved significantly with access to their own notes.<p>Granular filtering instead of a single score:<p>We classify stories upfront by language, genre, tags, and content rating. Instead of one &quot;creative writing&quot; leaderboard, we can drill into specifics: which model writes the best Spanish Comedy? Which handles LitRPG stories with Male Leads the best? Which does well with romance versus horror?<p>The answers aren&#x27;t always what you&#x27;d expect from general benchmarks. Some models that rank mid-tier overall dominate specific niches.<p>A few features I&#x27;m proud of:<p>Story forking lets readers branch stories CYOA-style – if you don&#x27;t like where the plot went, fork it and see how the same model handles the divergence. Creates natural A&#x2F;B comparisons.<p>Visual LitRPG was a personal itch to scratch. Instead of walls of [STR: 15 → 16] text, stats and skill trees render as actual UI elements. Example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrator.sh&#x2F;novel&#x2F;beware-the-starter-pet&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;1\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;narrator.sh&#x2F;novel&#x2F;beware-the-starter-pet&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;1</a><p>What I&#x27;m looking for:<p>More readers to build out the engagement data. Also curious if anyone else working on long-form LLM generation has found better patterns for maintaining consistency across chapters – the agent harness approach works but I&#x27;m sure there are improvements.",

      "body": "Hey HN, I am Dimittri and we’re building Sonarly (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonarly.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonarly.com</a>), an AI engineer for production. It connects to your observability tools like Sentry, Datadog, or user feedback channels, triages issues, and fixes them to cut your resolution time. Here&#x27;s a demo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rr3VHv0eRdw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=rr3VHv0eRdw</a>.<p>Sonarly is really about removing the noise from production alerts by grouping duplicates and returning a root cause analysis to save time to on-call engineers and literally cut your MTTR.<p>Before starting this company, my co-founder and I had a B2C app in edtech and had, some days, thousands of users using the app. We pushed several times a day, relying on user feedback. Then we set up Sentry, it was catching a lot of bugs, but we had up to 50 alerts a day. With 2 people it&#x27;s a lot. We took a lot of time filtering the noise to find the real signal so we knew which bug to focus on.<p>At the same time, we saw how important it is to fix a bug fast when it hits users. A bug means in the worst case a churn and at best a frustrated user. And there are always bugs in production, due to code errors, database mismatches, infrastructure overload, and many issues are linked to a specific user behavior. You can&#x27;t catch all these beforehand, even with E2E tests or AI code reviews (which catch a lot of bugs but obviously not all, plus it takes time to run at each deployment). This is even more true with vibe-coding (or agentic engineering).<p>We started Sonarly with this idea. More software than ever is being built and users should have the best experience possible on every product. The main idea of Sonarly is to reduce the MTTR (Mean Time To Repair).<p>We started by recreating a Sentry-like tool but without the noise, using only text and session replays as the interface. We built our own frontend tracker (based on open-source rrweb) and used the backend Sentry SDK (open source as well). Companies could just add another tracker in the frontend and add a DSN in their Sentry config to send data to us in addition to Sentry.<p>We wanted to build an interface where you don&#x27;t need to check logs, dashboards, traces, metrics, and code, as the agent would do it for you with plain English to explain the &quot;what,&quot; &quot;why,&quot; and &quot;how do I fix it.&quot;<p>We quickly realized companies don&#x27;t want to add a new tracker or change their monitoring stack, as these platforms do the job they&#x27;re supposed to do. So we decided to build above them. Now we connect to tools like Sentry, Datadog, Slack user feedback channels, and other integrations.<p>Claude Code is so good at writing code, but handling runtime issues requires more than just raw coding ability. It demands deep runtime context, immediate reactivity, and intelligent triage, you can’t simply pipe every alert directly into an agent. That’s why our first step is converting noise into signal. We group duplicates and filter false positives to isolate clear issues. Once we have a confirmed signal, we trigger Claude Code with the exact context it needs, like the specific Sentry issue and relevant logs fetched via MCP (mostly using grep on Datadog&#x2F;Grafana). However, things get exponentially harder with multi-repo and multi-service architectures.<p>So we built an internal map of the production system that is basically a .md file updated dynamically. It shows every link between different services, logs, and metrics so that Claude Code can understand the issue faster.<p>One of our users using Sentry was receiving ~180 alerts&#x2F;day. Here is what their workflow looked like:<p>- Receive the alert<p>- 1) Defocus from their current task or wake up, or 2) don&#x27;t look at the alert at all (most of the time)<p>- Go check dashboards to find the root cause (if infra type) or read the stack trace, events, etc.<p>- Try to figure out if it was a false positive or a real problem (or a known problem already in the fixes pipeline)<p>- Then fix by giving Claude Code the correct context<p>We started by cutting the noise and went from 180&#x2F;day to 50&#x2F;day (by grouping issues) and giving a severity based on the impact on the user&#x2F;infra. This brings it down to 5 issues to focus on in the current day. Triage happens in 3 steps: deduplicating before triggering a coding agent, gathering the root cause for each alert, and re-grouping by RCA.<p>We launched self-serve (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonarly.com\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonarly.com</a>) and we would love to have feedback from engineers. Especially curious about your current workflows when you receive an alert from any of these channels like Sentry (error tracking), Datadog (APM), or user feedback.

      "title": "Anam Cara-3: Why we think AI needs a face",
      "body": "Hey HN, we&#x27;re Ben and Caoimhe, cofounders of Anam. We built a service for interactive avatars and just shipped our latest model, cara-3. Try it at anam.ai, no sign-up required, or build with it at lab.anam.ai or anam.ai&#x2F;cookbook.<p>Some context on why we&#x27;re working on this: faces carry emotional signal that text and voice don&#x27;t. Almost half the human brain is devoted to visual processing, and it&#x27;s one of the first\nthings we learn as babies. It&#x27;s also a more accessible medium. Anam started, in part, from Ben watching his gran struggle with her iPad and thinking there should be a face she could just talk to.<p>cara-3 uses a two-stage pipeline: a diffusion transformer converts audio to motion embeddings (head position, eye gaze, lip shape, expression), then a rendering model applies those to a reference image to produce video frames. Separating motion from rendering means we can animate any face without retraining. The two models run in sequence within ~70ms time-to-first-frame on an H200, so we can run many concurrent avatar sessions on a single GPU.<p>The core of audio-to-motion is flow matching, but we found off-the-shelf formulations weren&#x27;t stable enough for this task, so we developed a novel variant. We also built our own training data pipeline (and recently open-sourced the backbone: Metaxy) because existing frameworks made it hard to iterate without rerunning expensive steps.<p>We commissioned an independent blind evaluation comparing interactive avatars from Anam with HeyGen, Tavus and D-ID. Hundreds of participants played 20 Questions with the different offerings and cara-3 scored highest on every metric (p &lt; 0.001), 24% above the closest competitor on average. What surprised us most: responsiveness correlated with overall experience (Spearman 0.697) far more than visual quality (0.473). In interactive settings, how fast you respond matters more than how good you look.<p>Ask us anything!",

I constantly need access to SSH passwords (where keys aren&#x27;t an option), specific IP addresses, and complex CLI one-liners. I realized I was storing them in insecure text files or sticky notes because standard clipboard managers felt too bloated and password managers were too slow for my workflow.<p>I wanted a &quot;warehouse&quot; for this data—something that lives quietly in the system tray, supports deep hierarchy, works completely offline, and looks industrial.<p>The app is built with Rust and Tauri v2. The core technical challenge was mapping a local JSON tree structure directly to a recursive native OS tray menu. This allows you to navigate nested folders just by hovering, without opening a window.<p>For security, I implemented AES-256-GCM encryption with Argon2 for key derivation. When the vault locks, the sensitive data is wiped from memory, and the tray menu collapses to a locked state.<p>It was an interesting journey building this on the Tauri v2 Beta ecosystem. I’d love to hear your feedback on the implementation, especially regarding the Rust-side security logic.<p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Rench321&#x2F;sklad\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Rench321&#x2F;sklad</a>",

Not only has AI failed to replace Excel in its entirety, but it has also failed to replace any of its features. AI was simply appended as an additional feature in the form of an agentic chatbot. This has been the trend across the entire industry, and it’s why AI has failed to fundamentally transform any of our exiting software application.<p>Now you might ask: what about AI native applications? Well, as it turns out, most of them are essentially clones of existing software but with a chatbot slapped on top. Because of the error prone nature of AI, any application that leverages it also has to surface all of the controls required to override all of its decisions. So you end up with a traditional software application plus AI.<p>AI promised to transform and even replace software applications, but all it did instead was augment them with an unreliable chatbot.

Reality disagrees at 11 PM when everything falls apart.<p>DayZen is my solution: your day as a 24-hour radial clock. Tasks become colored arcs. When the circle fills up, it&#x27;s full. No more lying to yourself about what actually fits.<p>Just shipped 1.4 with Focus Mode\nThe new version adds features I&#x27;ve wanted since day one:<p>Focus Mode: Full-screen timer that zooms into your current task. Distractions fade, simple controls keep you on track. Built it because I kept checking my phone to see &quot;what&#x27;s next&quot; and losing 15 minutes to Reddit.<p>Live Activities + Dynamic Island: Your active focus session shows on Lock Screen with time remaining and progress bar. Sounds simple, but it&#x27;s been genuinely game-changing for staying aware without pulling out my phone.<p>Insights: Added analytics (today&#x2F;weekly&#x2F;monthly&#x2F;yearly) with streaks and category breakdowns. Turns out I spend 40% of my time on &quot;Important but not urgent&quot; which explains a lot.<p>Time awareness improvements: Specifically designed for ADHD time blindness. Visual feedback makes abstract time concrete.<p>Why a radial clock?\nLinear lists hide the finite nature of your day. They feel infinite, so you keep adding tasks. A circle forces honesty. Conflicts glow red immediately. You see gaps. You make the hard choices before the day starts, not at midnight when you&#x27;re burned out.\nTechnical details:<p>Built native iOS with SwiftUI\nTwo-way calendar sync (Google, Outlook, Apple)\nLocal-first, iCloud sync between devices\nNo account needed, no tracking, no ads\nLock Screen widgets use WidgetKit with Live Activities API\nRecurring tasks auto-generate instances for next 30 days<p>Privacy approach:\nYour schedule stays on your device. I don&#x27;t collect, sell, or see your data. No analytics, no crash reporting, no server calls except calendar sync (which uses system auth). This was non-negotiable for me as both an ADHD person and someone who values privacy.<p>Looking for feedback on:<p>Does the radial approach click for you, or is it too different?<p>Focus Mode UX: Does the minimalism help or is it too minimal?<p>What other time-blindness features would help?<p>Try it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dayzen.xyz&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dayzen.xyz&#x2F;</a><p>Site:Happy to answer questions about the technical implementation or design decisions.

MCP standardizes how you connect to a tool server. Axiomeer operates one layer up: which tool, from which provider, and can you trust what came back?<p>Stack: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Ollama (local LLM, no API keys). v1 ships with weather providers (Open-Meteo + mocks).

This is an automated system that waits for a voice, and I said &#x27;Yo&#x27; into the handset. Immediately after the loudest recording I&#x27;ve ever heard played through the speaker causing sharp pain and ringing as the handset was seated directly over my left ear.

I just answered as it was a normal call, no speaker option and I am certain I did not increase volume after the call began.

      "body": "Hey HN! Arjun and Sid here.<p>Fostrom is an IoT Cloud Platform designed for developers to make it really easy to get started and scale fleets. We have Device SDKs (in Python, JS, Elixir, more coming soon), Typed Schemas, Per-Device Mailboxes, Programmable Actions, 4 Global Regions for lower-latency connections, and much more.<p>We&#x27;ve built Fostrom to solve a real need we faced in our previous startup, building a fully automated indoor vertical farm. We spent more time figuring out IoT infrastructure than writing automation logic. Fostrom is the platform we wished existed back then.<p>Over the last few years we&#x27;ve experimented with a lot of interesting tech and architectures, and settled on an architecture that we believe is quite elegant. We wrote a Go&lt;-&gt;Elixir bridge to execute JS code in WASM for Actions, implemented a DuckDB library for Elixir, and wrote a Device Agent in Rust that our SDKs run in the background (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fostrom&#x2F;devicekit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fostrom&#x2F;devicekit</a>).<p>The most interesting realization we had was about the data architecture. For years, we tried using distributed databases and built complex layers on top of them, but all approaches had significant limitations specifically around consistency and querying. We want to provide operational correctness, rich insights, and reliability. Finally, we came to the conclusion that to achieve this we really need a SQL database for fleet data. So we built a DuckDB-based replicated multi-tenant data layer. We&#x27;re still improving it (hence the Technical Preview badge) but we&#x27;re quite proud of this decision. It simplifies the rest of the codebase, while keeping operational complexity in just a few places.<p>Our vision is to make a powerful IoT platform that enables you to build correct, secure, and reliable connected systems without dealing with any of the plumbing or infrastructure.<p>Next up, we&#x27;re gonna launch our CLI, add automatic device monitoring to our Device SDKs, and improve the debugging experience. We have some pretty cool ideas to make Fostrom and the experience of developing connected systems better. We&#x27;re also going to write more about our architecture and journey soon.<p>We also published our launch blog post which goes into more detail about our vision, what we&#x27;ve built, and our future plans: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fostrom.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-fostrom\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fostrom.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-fostrom</a><p>Would love for you to try out Fostrom and give us your feedback and thoughts.",

      "title": "Show HN: Model Tools Protocol (MTP) – Forget MCP, bash is all you need",
      "body": "Recently I was trying to use an MCP server to pull data from a service, but hit a limitation: the MCP didn&#x27;t expose the data I needed, even though the service&#x27;s REST API supported it. So I wrote a quick CLI wrapper around the API. Worked great, except Claude Code had no structured way to know what my CLI does or how to call it. For `gh` or `curl` the model can learn from the extensive training data, but for a tool I just wrote, it was stabbing in the dark.<p>MCP solves this discovery problem, but it does it by rebuilding tool interaction from scratch: server processes, JSON-RPC transport, client-host handshakes. It got discovery right but threw out composability to get there. You can&#x27;t pipe one MCP tool into another or run one in a cron job without a host process. Pulling a Confluence page, checking Jira for duplicates, and filing a ticket is three inference round-trips for work that should be a bash one-liner. I also seem to endlessly get asked to re-login to my MCPs, something `gh` CLI never asks me to do.<p>I think the industry took a wrong turn here. We didn&#x27;t need a new execution model for tools, we needed to add one capability to the execution model we already had. That&#x27;s what Model Tools Protocol (MTP) is: a spec for making any CLI self-describing so LLMs can discover and use it.<p>MTP does that with a single convention: your CLI responds to `--mtp-describe` with a JSON schema describing its commands, args, types, and examples. No server, no transport, no handshake. I wrote SDKs for Click (Python), Commander.js (TypeScript), Cobra (Go), and Clap (Rust) that introspect the types and help strings your framework already has, so adding `--mtp-describe` to an existing CLI is a single function call.<p>I don&#x27;t think MCP should disappear, so there&#x27;s a bidirectional bridge. `mtpcli serve` exposes any `--mtp-describe` CLI as an MCP server, and `mtpcli wrap` goes the other direction, turning MCP servers into pipeable CLIs. The ~2,500 MCP servers out there become composable CLI tools you can script and run in CI without an LLM in the loop.<p>The real payoff is composition: your custom CLI, a third-party MCP server, and jq in a single pipeline, no tokens burned. I&#x27;ll post a concrete example in the comments.<p>Try it:<p><pre><code>  npm i -g @modeltoolsprotocol&#x2F;mtpcli &amp;&amp; mtpcli --mtp-describe\n</code></pre>\nI know it&#x27;s unlikely this will take off as I can&#x27;t compete with the great might of Anthropic, but I very much welcome collaborators on this. PRs are welcome on the spec, additional SDKs, or anything else.

      "body": "Hi HN,<p>I am a 75-year-old former fishmonger from Japan. Currently, I work at the compensation desk for the Fukushima nuclear disaster (TEPCO). Witnessing deep social divisions and the limitations of bureaucracy firsthand, I realized we need a new way for people to express their will without being &quot;disposable.&quot;<p>To address this, I’ve designed the *Virtual Protest Protocol (VPP)*. It’s an OSS framework for large-scale, 2D avatar-based digital demonstrations. I recently shared this with the *Open Technology Fund (OTF)* and received an encouraging &quot;This is great&quot; response. Now, I am looking for the HN community&#x27;s expertise to turn this spec into a reality.<p>*The Concept:*\n* *Beyond Yes&#x2F;No (Avoiding Polarization):* Introducing an *&quot;Observe&quot;* status. Modern social media forces people into binary &quot;For or Against&quot; camps, deepening social division. VPP allows the silent majority to participate by simply &quot;being there,&quot; visualizing the scale of public concern without forcing a polarized stance.\n* *Cell-Based Scaling:* To handle thousands of participants, avatars are managed in &quot;cells&quot; of 50 units. New cells instantiate as the crowd grows, ensuring compatibility with low-spec devices and low-bandwidth environments.\n* *Privacy by Design:* We only collect anonymous attributes (age&#x2F;gender&#x2F;region). All event-specific data is wiped immediately after the demonstration.\n* *OIN Membership:* We have joined the [Open Invention Network (OIN)](<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openinventionnetwork.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openinventionnetwork.com</a>) to ensure this remains a patent-free global public good.<p>*Why I’m doing this:*\nAt 75, I belong to the generation that will soon &quot;retire&quot; from society. I feel a deep sense of responsibility to leave a better infrastructure for the next generation?one that isn&#x27;t burdened by the financial and social &quot;debt&quot; we&#x27;ve accumulated.

The agent resolved the submodule conflict correctly, but then proceeded to run git push --force-with-lease --no-verify without asking for permission - directly violating my rules.<p>The agent&#x27;s defense was reasonable (&quot;force push is expected after a rebase&quot;), but that&#x27;s exactly why I want to be asked first.

I&#x27;m Maxime, founder at LimaCharlie (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;limacharlie.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;limacharlie.io</a>), a Hyperscaler for SecOps (access building blocks you need to build security operations, like AWS does for IT).<p>We’ve engineered a new product on our platform that solves a timely issue acting as a guardrail between your AI and the world: Viberails (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viberails.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.viberails.io</a>)<p>This won&#x27;t be new to folks here, but we identified 4 challenges teams face right now with AI tools:<p><pre><code>  1. Auditing what the tools are doing.\n  2. Controlling toolcalls (and their impact on the world).\n  3. Centralized management.\n  4. Easy access to the above.\n</code></pre>\nTo expand:\nAudit logs are the bread and butter for security, but this hasn&#x27;t really caught up in AI tooling yet. Being able to look back and say &quot;what actually happened&quot; after the fact is extremely valuable during an incident and for compliance purposes.<p>Tool calls are how LLMs interact with the world, we should be able to exercise basic controls over them like: don&#x27;t read credential files, don&#x27;t send emails out, don&#x27;t create SSH keys etc. Being able to not only see those calls but also block them is key for preventing incidents.<p>As soon as you move beyond a single contributor on one box, the issue becomes: how do I scale processes  by creating an authoritative config for the team. Having one spot with all the audit, detection and control policies becomes critical. It&#x27;s the same story as snowflake-servers.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s plenty of companies that make products that partially address this, but they fall in one of two buckets:<p><pre><code>  - They don&#x27;t handle the &quot;centralized&quot; point above, meaning they just send to syslog and leave all the messy infra bits to you.\n  - They are locked behind &quot;book a demo&quot;, sales teams, contracts and all the wasted energy that goes with that.\n</code></pre>\nWe made Viberails address these problems. Here&#x27;s what it is:<p><pre><code>  - OpenSource client, written in Rust\n  - Curl-to-bash install, share a URL with your team to join your Team, done. Linux, MacOS and Windows support.\n  - Detects local AI tools, you choose which ones you want to install. We install hooks for each relevant platform. The hooks use the CLI tool. We support all the major tools (including OpenClaw).\n  - The CLI tool sends webhooks into your Team (tenant, called Organization in LC) in LimaCharlie. The tool-related hooks are blocking to allow for control.\n  - Blocking webhooks have around 50ms RTT.\n  - Your tenant in LC records the interaction for audit.\n  - We create an initial set of detection rules for you as examples. They do not block by default. You can create your own rules, no opaque black boxes.\n  - You can view the audit, the alerts, etc. in the cloud.\n  - You can setup outputs to send audits, blocking events and detections to all kinds of other platforms of your choosing. Easy mode of this is coming, right now this is done in the main LC UI and not the simplified Viberails view.\n  - The detection&#x2F;blocking rules support all kinds of operators and logic, lots of customizability.\n  - All data is retained for 1 year unless you delete the tenant. Datacenters in USA, Canada, Europe, UK, Australia and India.\n  - Only limit to community edition for this is a global throughput of 10kbps for ingestion.\n</code></pre>\nTry it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;viberails.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;viberails.io</a><p>Repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;refractionPOINT&#x2F;viberails\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;refractionPOINT&#x2F;viberails</a><p>Essentially, we wanted to make a super-simplified solution for all kinds of devs and teams so that they can get access to the basics of securing their AI tools.\nThanks for reading - we’re really excited to share this with the community!

      "body": "Video: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;JR14egcqfg8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;JR14egcqfg8</a><p>It&#x27;s hard to find an audiobook player that can be easily used by a non-tech-savvy, visually impaired elderly people (and I mean 85+, not 60 years old &quot;seniors&quot;).<p>So I have built my own.<p>I&#x27;m terrible at hardware hacking and I wanted to make something that others can replicate easily. There are many awesome RaspberryPi based projects out there but they&#x27;re not for me.\nSo my approach was to: use off-the-shelf consumer products: a cheap tablet, a smart case etc. and write an app to push it as far as I can.<p>I have created Homer Audio Player with the following assumptions and functionality:<p>- it&#x27;s meant for two users: a caregiver who manages content and a listener who controls only playback,<p>- lockdown&#x2F;kiosk mode - notifications, system navigation and other apps are hidden from the user - this converts an Android device to a dedicated device,<p>- hidden settings section (optionally) - there&#x27;s no chance for an accidental tap to &quot;break&quot; anything,<p>- mainly for audiobooks, but will play anything,<p>- simplified podcast support - the listener can choose only from a small number (1-5) of the most recent episodes,<p>- unique features for older users, e.g. you can add extra screen margins to have more area to hold the device by,<p>- balance between simplicity and functionality: you can enable&#x2F;disable particular controls like volume, rewind etc.<p>In the end you get a robust audio device with simple user interface and some hidden smarts.<p>It has been battle‑tested by my grandmother for over ten years.<p>Technical stuff:<p>Kiosk mode is implemented with standard Android for enterprise functionality.\nThe device needs to be factory reset and set up as a &quot;company owned&quot; device by installing a special companion app.\nThe companion app is a device policy controller (DPC) that grants the Homer Audio Player app permissions to enable Android&#x27;s &quot;lock task&quot;. The player app can then pin itself to the screen. It&#x27;s the regular &quot;task pinning&quot; but it can&#x27;t be unpinned by user gestures, only by the app itself (which is exposed to the caregiver user in settings).\nIt&#x27;s relatively friendly to non-technical users. The device can be reverted back to its original state by doing a factory reset.\nAndroid Docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.android.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;devices&#x2F;admin#fully-managed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;source.android.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;devices&#x2F;admin#fully-managed</a><p>Touch screen as input device is not ideal for visually impaired users. It would be much better to have tactile buttons.\nBut I had to work with this limitation by using:<p>- the accelerometer for &quot;flip-to-stop&quot; - placing the device with screen down stops playback,<p>- 8&quot; tablet so that the buttons are large enough to see and hit even for low-vision users.<p>- I haven&#x27;t enabled TalkBack for my grandmother&#x27;s device as I&#x27;m afraid it might be a bit too techy and requires relatively good motor skills. However buttons are properly labelled for accessibility services.<p>Text-to-speech comes free on Android for so many languages. So far it&#x27;s being used to read titles while swiping but I may use it a bit more in the future, e.g. to signal end of audiobook.<p>Regular Android is running underneath, so any apps can be installed to run in the background. I use &quot;Autosync for Google Drive&quot; to sync a folder and thus manage audiobooks on the device remotely by modifying content in a shared Google Drive folder. I know other users use SyncThing and similar solutions.<p>I wanted to make a device but I can only make apps, so I made an app that makes the most of a mass-market device.\nI&#x27;d love to hear your feedback or suggestions.<p>Videos: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homeraudioplayer.app&#x2F;videos\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;homeraudioplayer.app&#x2F;videos</a>\nGoogle Play: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.studio4plus.homerplayer2\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.studio4plu...</a> \nF-droid: coming soon!\nGitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;msimonides&#x2F;homerplayer2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;msimonides&#x2F;homerplayer2</a>\nBlueSky: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;homeraudioplayer.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bsky.app&#x2F;profile&#x2F;homeraudioplayer.app</a>",

      "body": "Hey HN! I built Lumina – an open-source observability platform for AI&#x2F;LLM applications. Self-host it in 5 minutes with Docker Compose, all features included.<p>The Problem:<p>I&#x27;ve been building LLM apps for the past year, and I kept running into the same issues:\n- LLM responses would randomly change after prompt tweaks, breaking things\n- Costs would spike unexpectedly (turns out a bug was hitting GPT-4 instead of 3.5)\n- No easy way to compare &quot;before vs after&quot; when testing prompt changes\n- Existing tools were either too expensive or missing features in free tiers<p>What I Built:<p>Lumina is OpenTelemetry-native, meaning:\n- Works with your existing OTEL stack (Datadog, Grafana, etc.)\n- No vendor lock-in – standard trace format\n- Integrates in 3 lines of code<p>Key features:\n- Cost &amp; quality monitoring\n– Automatic alerts when costs spike or responses degrade\n- Replay testing\n– Capture production traces, replay them after changes, see diffs\n- Semantic comparison\n– Not just string matching \n– uses Claude to judge if responses are &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot;\n- Self-hosted tier \n– 50k traces&#x2F;day, 7-day retention, ALL features included (alerts, replay, semantic scoring)<p>How it works:<p>Start Lumina<p>git clone <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;use-lumina&#x2F;Lumina\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;use-lumina&#x2F;Lumina</a>\ncd Lumina&#x2F;infra&#x2F;docker\ndocker-compose up -d<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; Add to your app (no API key needed for self-hosted!)<p>import { Lumina } from &#x27;@uselumina&#x2F;sdk&#x27;;<p>const lumina = new Lumina({\n  endpoint: &#x27;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:8080&#x2F;v1&#x2F;traces&#x27;,\n});<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; Wrap your LLM call\nconst response = await lumina.traceLLM(\n  async () =&gt; await openai.chat.completions.create({...}),\n  { provider: &#x27;openai&#x27;, model: &#x27;gpt-4&#x27;, prompt: &#x27;...&#x27; }\n);<p>That&#x27;s it. Every LLM call is now tracked with cost, latency, tokens, and quality scores.<p>What makes it different:<p>1. Free self-hosted with limits that work\n– 50k traces&#x2F;day and 7-day retention (resets daily at midnight UTC). All features included: alerts, replay testing, semantic scoring. Perfect for most development and small production workloads. Need more? Upgrade to managed cloud.<p>2. OpenTelemetry-native – Not another proprietary format. Use standard OTEL exporters, works with existing infra. Can send traces to both Lumina AND Datadog simultaneously.<p>3. Replay testing – The killer feature. Capture 100 production traces, change your prompt, replay them all, get a semantic diff report. Like snapshot testing for LLMs.<p>4. Fast\n– Built with Bun, Postgres, Redis, NATS. Sub-500ms from trace to alert. Handles 10k+ traces&#x2F;min on a single machine.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for:<p>- Feedback on the approach (is OTEL the right foundation?)\n- Bug reports (tested on Mac&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;WSL2, but I&#x27;m sure there are issues)\n- Ideas for what features matter most (alerts? replay? cost tracking?)\n- Help with the semantic scorer (currently uses Claude, want to make it pluggable)<p>Why open source:<p>I want this to be the standard for LLM observability. That only works if it&#x27;s:\n- Free to use and modify (Apache 2.0)\n- Easy to self-host (Docker Compose, no cloud dependencies)\n- Open to contributions (good first issues tagged)<p>The business model is managed hosting for teams who don&#x27;t want to run infrastructure. But the core product is and always will be free.<p>Try it:\n- GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;use-lumina&#x2F;Lumina\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;use-lumina&#x2F;Lumina</a>\n- Demo video: [YouTube link]\n- Docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.uselumina.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.uselumina.io</a>\n- Quick start: 5 minutes from `git clone` to dashboard<p>I&#x27;d love to hear what you think! Especially interested in:\n- What observability problems you&#x27;re hitting with LLMs\n- Missing features that would make this useful for you\n- Any similar tools you&#x27;re using (and what they do better)<p>Thanks for reading!",

      "body": "Saw the remotion claude skills launch earlier, and honestly even though I was surprised how decent some of the results turned out to be I ended up never trying it out with claude code because I knew I&#x27;d have to setup remotion, bundler etc and if I was already doing it once I thought I might as well turn it into a site where anyone could just write messages and get a video without any prerequisites.<p>I also know Claude Code is not something everyone has and setting up remotion is a pain. And one of the biggest lessons I learned from this whole experience is that Opus is actually not that good at design tasks even with the skills, Gemini is what I&#x27;m using for Framecall and even Flash(Fast Mode) produces sometimes better results than Opus, crazy considering the cost difference.<p>Some other things I learned is that motion videos have the same &quot;problem&quot; as writing good code or using claude code as a vibe-coder vs someone who knows the framework they&#x27;re working with. If you just say &quot;Make a nice video about X&quot; its usually a gamble if the end result will be good, same as if you say &quot;Make me x application&quot; with claude code. You need to have a good eye for design and some terminology to know what exactly it is you want to achieve.<p>K2.5, ZLM and most of the open source models were pretty bad at making videos even with the skills so I ended up not adding them as an option.<p>The pricing is there because turns out having 2-5k+ tokens of code output for every animation + 1-2k of tokens for the remotion skills as input is kinda expensive. Would&#x27;ve loved to offer this as just a free product since I made it for fun anyways but oh well.",

      "body": "Hello HN,<p>Two of my blog posts[1][2] did quite well here on HN so I just wanted you all to know that moving forward these posts will only be accessible on IPv6 Internet.<p>But why? It&#x27;s a form of protest against people who refuse to give IPv6 a fair chance. I have read all sorts of reasons for why IPv6 is a bad idea including the most idiotic take where people disable IPv6 because all devices get exposed to Internet. They don&#x27;t care to learn about firewall and keep using IPv4 out of laziness.<p>Second reason is I don&#x27;t have to pay for static IPv4 address. The cost of IPv4 may look trivial to people who have steady flow of income but sadly that is not the case for me. I like hosting on Raspberry Pi and with IPv6 I can do just that.<p>Another reason is, in India, we have layers and layers of CGNAT. It degrades the Internet experience for us. With IPv6 that is not the case.<p>I&#x27;m fully aware that this move will most likely hurt my traffic but I like IPv6 and it&#x27;s convenience, enough to stick with my decision. It&#x27;s my humble request to you all to give IPv6 a fair chance by enabling it across your networks and web services. When you choose only IPv4 you are not thinking about part of the world where 1.5 billion people are trying to access your service. It&#x27;s high time, we should have moved to IPv6 long back.

There&#x27;s a lot of nepotism, too.<p>AI is the personal computer moment for film. The DAW.<p>One of my friends has done rotoscoping with live actors:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Tii9uF0nAx4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Tii9uF0nAx4</a><p>The Corridor folks show off a lot of creativity with this tech:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_9LX9HSQkWo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_9LX9HSQkWo</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DSRrSO7QhXY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DSRrSO7QhXY</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iq5JaG53dho\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iq5JaG53dho</a><p>We&#x27;ve been making silly shorts ourselves:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oqoCWdOwr2U\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oqoCWdOwr2U</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=H4NFXGMuwpY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=H4NFXGMuwpY</a><p>The secret is that a lot of studios have been using AI for well over a year now.

It&#x27;s the &quot;bad toupee fallacy&quot; - you&#x27;ll only notice it when it&#x27;s bad, and they&#x27;ll never tell you otherwise.<p>Comfy is neat, but I work with folks that don&#x27;t intuit node graphs and that either don&#x27;t have graphics cards with adequate VRAM, or that can&#x27;t manage Python dependencies.

      "body": "I&#x27;ve been programming since 1997. I&#x27;ve worked in the trenches at international e-commerce companies, lead dev teams at startups, everything in between. I now run a web dev company (not linked cause I&#x27;m not tryna drum up new business with &quot;content&quot;). I give webinars. I speak at events. I&#x27;ve been around.<p>So it&#x27;s from a place of wisdom when I say it&#x27;s been impossible for me to ignore how absolutely world-destroying AI&#x2F;LLM technology is on so very many levels. Not just for coders. The whole of it. The environmental impact, the global job market, education; it&#x27;s truly catastrophic, our industry is embracing it, and don&#x27;t understand why. We of all people should know better.<p>That&#x27;s not even taking into account their efficacy, or lack thereof. I do my best to keep up. I&#x27;ve listened with an open mind to what advocates have to say. I&#x27;ve held my nose and experimented with them in a variety of ways; vibe coding, small fns, proposals, research, etc. I&#x27;ve tried to engineer better prompts with rubrics and xml-based formatting. I remain unconvinced any of this is worth the global cost.<p>As a coding tool, it&#x27;s often flat out wrong and produces unusable or destructive results. Search &quot;cursor delete files&quot; and read about vibe coders who have had swaths of code deleted because claude got silly and these dummies don&#x27;t know about version control. Look up the AI 12x problem; how coding time has dropped significantly, but code review and maintenance time has skyrocketed: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webmatrices.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;vibe-coding-has-a-12x-cost-problem-maintainers-are-done<p>It gets worse the further you zoom out.<p>How many hallucinations and &quot;use krazy glue to stick cheese to your pizza&quot;s until people realize LLMs _suck at knowing things_ and they&#x27;re not improving. We&#x27;ve reached the theoretical limits of the tech. Beyond small tasks like grammar and natural-language search, they get brittle af.<p>So why is everyone hyping AI? Why is everyone gung-ho to put half of the world&#x27;s knowledge-workers out of a job and push our power grid to its absolute limits for something that has the success rate of a freshman intern?<p>--<p>Economically it&#x27;s no better.<p>The ghouls who run these AI companies and their infestors are betting on AGI. But as the engineers in the field know, AGI is not possible with the LLM modality. They hope building massive data centers to hold historic amounts of processing power and training data will somehow crack it. But &quot;morer and betterer&quot; is a hail mary — even without new limitations re: copyrighted material.<p>Instead, they&#x27;ll continue accruing massive circular debts. Nvidia investing in (loaning money to) openAI so openAI can buy more nvidia chips so nvidia and invest more until it spins out of control. AI companies are losing _billions of dollars_ every year with no path to solvency.<p>It&#x27;s no wonder Apple peaced the fuck out of their LLM efforts and just offloaded to Google. There&#x27;s no win scenario in dumping billions into a plagiarism-and-lying machine.<p>--<p>In the end, I just don&#x27;t understand how people can continue to advocate for these things. With all we know about how these work and what it all costs and will cost society on a global scale, you&#x27;d have to be deluded, ignorant, or callous to advocate or even casually use this shit. I understand some folks feel like they _have_ to learn these things to ensure they still have a role in our industry. But none of this is sustainable.<p>I don&#x27;t get it.",

When a developer starts building an API, the tool automatically loads the relevant standard. No plugins to write, no code.

They&#x27;re either too slow, make real-time collaboration painful during live incidents, or force you to fight with different log formats instead of actually investigating.<p>What Gulp does differently:<p>- Visual timeline analysis — Our color-coded timeline visualization lets you spot anomalies instantly. Instead of drowning in raw logs, suspicious events, correlations, and IoCs literally jump out at you. Different colors tell different stories; one look tells you where to dig.<p>- Actually fast — Built on OpenSearch 3.x, PostgreSQL and Redis. Horizontal scaling via load-balanced instances when you need to handle serious volume.<p>- Real-time collaboration — Multiple analysts working the same incident, synchronized timelines, shared notes. No more &quot;wait, which events were you looking at?&quot;<p>- Native format support — EVTX, PCAP, Suricata, Zeek, ElasticSearch, Wazuh, and more out of the box. Plus ECS mapping, SIGMA rules, and OpenSearch queries.<p>- AI-powered hunting — Built-in AI Assistant plugin (free in Community Edition) that flags suspicious events and correlates across sources. One click to find shared indicators.<p>New in 1.6.0: Rewritten collaboration engine with WebSocket-based real-time updates, real-time network sensor ingestion (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mentat-is&#x2F;slurp-ebpf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mentat-is&#x2F;slurp-ebpf</a> for a working eBPF example), new plugins (Suricata, MemprocFS, Zeek, AI Assistant), manual query mode + table view, and auto-saved sessions.<p>Gulp uses an open core model. The Community Edition is fully open source (AGPL). We also offer a Pro version with advanced plugins for better AI features, automated reporting, Velociraptor integration, plus dedicated support.<p>Repos: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mentat-is&#x2F;gulp\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mentat-is&#x2F;gulp</a> (backend) and <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mentat-is&#x2F;gulpui-web\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mentat-is&#x2F;gulpui-web</a> (web UI)<p>Handling an incident with Gulp: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fl_jtCIIS2k\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=fl_jtCIIS2k</a><p>This is our first major public push — we&#x27;ve been iterating quietly and now feel it&#x27;s ready for wider use.

      "body": "Hi HN,<p>We built On-Call Health to help teams detect signs of overload in on-call incident responders. Burnout is too common for SREs and other on-call engineers and that’s who we serve at Rootly. We hope to put a dent in this problem with this tool.<p>Here is the project GitHub repo <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Rootly-AI-Labs&#x2F;On-Call-Health\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Rootly-AI-Labs&#x2F;On-Call-Health</a>, and here is the hosted version <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oncallhealth.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oncallhealth.ai</a>. The easiest way to try the tool is to log into the hosted version, which has mock data.<p>The tool uses two types of inputs:\n- Observed signals from tools like Rootly, PagerDuty, GitHub, Linear, and Jira (incident volume and severity, after-hours activity, task load…)\n- Self-reported check-ins, where responders periodically share how they&#x27;re feeling<p>We provide a &quot;risk level&quot;, a compound score derived from objective data. The self-reported check-in feature is taking inspiration from the Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), a research methodology also used by Apple Health&#x27;s State of Mind feature.<p>We provide trend data for all metrics, for both teams and individuals, to help managers spot anomalies that may require investigation. Our tool doesn&#x27;t provide a diagnosis, nor is it a medical tool; it simply highlights signals.<p>It can help spot two types of potential issues:<p>1. Existing high load: when setting up the tool, teams and individuals with a high risk level should be looked at. A high score doesn&#x27;t always mean there&#x27;s a problem – for example, some people thrive on high-severity incidents – but it can be a sign that something is already wrong.\n2. Growing risk: over time, if risk levels are steeply climbing above a team or individual baseline.<p>Users can consume the findings via our dashboard, AI-generated summaries, our API, or our MCP server.<p>The project is fully open source and self-hostable, and the hosted version is available at no cost. We have a ton of ideas to improve the tool to make on-call suck les,s and we are happily accepting PR and welcome feedback on our GitHub repo. You can reach out directly to me at jj@rootly.com",

      "body": "Hello HN, Lucas here.<p>I’ve been working with BigQuery for ~5 years, mostly in large (petabyte-scale) environments. Over time we ended up spending a lot of money and engineering effort just trying to understand where costs were coming from, why and how to optimize them.<p>At some point we decided to stop, leverage all our past experience and spend a full cycle building tooling focused on cost visibility and optimization. The main goal was to regain ownership of cost data and make it possible to understand our cost structure in under a minute, while aligning the views of engineering and FinOps at the project level. To complement these, and given the recent rise of AI, we also built agents that review usage patterns and selected KPIs to surface issues and suggest concrete optimizations (always through an encoding layer for privacy).<p>This ended up working well for us: we reduced monthly BigQuery spend by ~43% and made cost considerations part of normal engineering workflows instead of a separate FinOps exercise. After validating it with a few other teams facing similar problems, we decided to ship it publicly in November.<p>Some transparency items to consider:\n- We only work with bigquery related information, not all gcs.\n- While we already support most sources of cost, the project is in constant development. If you use an uncommon feature it may not be covered, but we will implement it for you.\n- The larger the company the larger the impact, since there tends to be larger technical debt. Nonetheless, we&#x27;ve seen significant impact in lower scale startups.\n- We dont need labels. Labels are great, and should be taken care of, but we do not depend on them to provide insights.<p>Happy to share details, lessons learned, or tradeoffs if this is interesting to others dealing with large-scale data warehouse costs.

And when a PR is merged, I am going to manually sync the original repository. I am not 100% happy with this because 1. this way I don&#x27;t totally leave github, 2. the syncing manually is tedious, 3. project&#x27;s issues history is on github and it is going to be vendor-locked.

      "body": "Hi HN, This started as a weekend brainfuck interpreter and kept growing. I got curious whether you could make a <i>usable</i> serverless platform out of languages that were never intended for this.<p>OtherFunc is a serverless function platform for languages no major cloud provider (to my knowledge) supports. There are currently implementations of brainfuck, Forth, APL, Lisp (Scheme-like), and BASIC.<p>The interpreters are written in Rust, compiled to a single Wasm binary, and deployed on Cloudflare Workers. You can finally write Forth and publish it as an HTTP endpoint. You can see some examples on the showcase page: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;otherfunc.com&#x2F;showcase\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;otherfunc.com&#x2F;showcase</a><p>- brainfuck can make HTTP requests. The tape is extended to 33,000 cells with a memory-mapped I&#x2F;O region. You write a URL to cells 30,000+, set a method byte, trigger execution, and the response appears in cells 31,000+. The Brainfuck program to do this runs ~35,000 characters, but it works.<p>- The interpreters use a coroutine&#x2F;yield pattern for I&#x2F;O instead of async. When code needs to make an HTTP call or access KV storage, the interpreter suspends with an IoRequest, the Worker performs the fetch, then resumes execution with the response.<p>- There&#x27;s an MCP server so AI assistants can deploy functions directly. The thought was, if an LLM is writing all your code anyway, the language it is written in doesn&#x27;t really matter. But you probably don&#x27;t want to waste your tokens writing bf either.<p>Code is available here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;otherfunc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;otherfunc</a>",

There&#x27;s a lot of nepotism, too.<p>AI is the personal computer moment for film.

You just don&#x27;t notice it, and they won&#x27;t ever tell you because of the stigma. It&#x27;s the &quot;bad toupee fallacy&quot; - you&#x27;ll only notice it when it&#x27;s bad, and they&#x27;ll never tell you otherwise.<p>Comfy is neat, but I work with folks that don&#x27;t intuit node graphs and that either don&#x27;t have graphics cards with adequate VRAM, or that can&#x27;t manage Python dependencies. The foundation models are all pretty competitive, and they&#x27;re becoming increasingly controllable - and that&#x27;s the big thing - control. So I&#x27;ve been working on the UI&#x2F;UX control layer.<p>ArtCraft has 2D and 3D control surfaces, where the 3D portion can be used as a strong and intuitive ControlNet for &quot;Image-to-Image&quot; (I2I) and &quot;Image-to-Video&quot; (I2V) workflows. It&#x27;s almost like a WYSIWYG, and I&#x27;m confident that this is the direction the tech will evolve for creative professionals rather than text-centric prompting.<p>I&#x27;ve been frustrated with tools like Gimp and Blender for a while. I&#x27;m no UX&#x2F;UI maestro, but I&#x27;ve never enjoyed complicated tools - especially complicated OSS tools. Commercial-grade tools are better. Figma is sublime. An IDE for creatives should be simple, magical, and powerful.<p>ArtCraft lets you drag and drop from a variety of creative canvases and an asset drawer easily. It&#x27;s fast and intuitive. Bouncing between text-to-image for quick prototyping, image editing, 3d gen, to 3d compositing is fluid. It feels like &quot;crafting&quot; rather than prompting or node graph wizardry.<p>ArtCraft, being a desktop app, lets us log you into 3rd party compute providers. I&#x27;m a big proponent of using and integrating the models you subscribe to wherever you have them. This has let us integrate WorldLabs&#x27; Marble Gaussian Splats, for instance, and nobody else has done that. My plan is to add every provider over time, including generic API key-based compute providers like FAL and Replicate. I don&#x27;t care if you pay for ArtCraft - I just want it to be useful.<p>Two disclaimers:<p>ArtCraft is &quot;fair source&quot; - I&#x27;d like to go the Cockroach DB route and eventually get funding, but keep the tool itself 100% source available for people to build and run for themselves. Obsidian, but with source code. If we got big, I&#x27;d spend a lot of time making movies.<p>Right now ArtCraft is tied to a lightweight cloud service - I don&#x27;t like this. It was a choice so I could reuse an old project and go fast, but I intend for this to work fully offline soon. All server code is in the monorepo, so you can run everything yourself. In the fullness of time, I do envision a portable OSS cloud for various AI tools to read&#x2F;write to like a Github for assets, but that&#x27;s just a distant idea right now.<p>I&#x27;ve written about roadmap in the repo: I&#x27;d like to develop integrations for every compute provider, rewrite the frontend UI&#x2F;UX in Bevy for a fully native client, and integrate local models too.",

This measure is allegedly to combat malware and slow the ability of repeat offenders to simply re-build and re-sign apps that have been blocked by Google Play Protect.<p>There is a lot of opposition to this effort (e.g., keepandroidopen.org, which I organize) along with widespread distrust of the claimed motives for the program.

It uses cgroup-based filtering so it only traces the target container, and CO-RE (BTF) so it works across kernel versions without recompilation.\nIt also has built-in heuristics that flag common malware behaviors: exec from &#x2F;tmp, sensitive file access, ptrace, W+X mmap, kernel module loading, etc.\nStack: Go + cilium&#x2F;ebpf + Docker Compose. Requires Linux 5.8+ with BTF.\nThis is the first release — it&#x27;s CLI-only for now. A proper dashboard is planned. Contributions welcome, especially around new detection heuristics and additional syscall hooks.",

      "body": "Hey HN,\nI&#x27;m George. I spent few months rebuilding Obooko, a free ebook platform that&#x27;s been around since 2010 with 11 million downloads. Reading is losing to scrolling, but BookTok has 370B+ views. People want book content, they&#x27;re just not reading books. I think that’s because modern reading hasn’t kept up with the pace of the internet.<p>What I built\nObooko is ad-supported like YouTube. No paywall, no subscription, no account required. 4,000+ books across 30+ genres. You can read in the browser, sync across devices, or download as PDF&#x2F;EPUB&#x2F;Kindle.\nThe reader is built on EPUB.js (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;futurepress&#x2F;epub.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;futurepress&#x2F;epub.js</a>). Frontend is vanilla JavaScript, no framework. Backend is Laravel handling progress tracking. The implementation uses continuous scrolling, font size controls (4 levels), chapter navigation, and persists reading progress to a pivot table via debounced API calls.\nIt&#x27;s still MVP quality. I went with EPUB.js because it was simpler to integrate and I wanted to ship fast. Now that I&#x27;m getting user feedback, the reader is the biggest pain point. (Actually, more books is now the #1 request, but reader UX is close behind.) I&#x27;m probably going to switch to Readium (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;readium\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;readium</a>) which looks more robust but is more work to integrate.<p>Being a solo founder \nThis is my third startup but first time doing it alone. I scaled SmartrMail to exit and built Bluethumb to $100M+ in art sales, but both had co-founders. The day-to-day whiplash of switching between growth work and building product is rough. Some days I&#x27;m doing SEO audits and writing blog posts, emails, social. Other days I&#x27;m debugging PHP. It feels so hard to get everything covered off, and then I spent time building automations for it in Claude but wonder if I’m over automating.<p>Maybe the hardest thing I’ve discovered as a solo founder is prioritisation and idea selection. I’m used to have someone to shoot down my dumb ideas. Now Claude just tells me every idea is amazing lol and I can get lost in a rabbit hole instead of really working on the most burning priority. And even daily taking stock of 100 to dos from backlog and working out which is #1, #2 is hard. Wondering how other solo founders do this better?<p>AI audiobooks (and video books):\nI&#x27;ve built an MVP with ElevenLabs Voice API and the narration quality is great. But it&#x27;s expensive. We&#x27;ve got close to 5,000 books and I can&#x27;t afford to narrate them all that way yet. One idea I have is that once I build native iOS, the on-device voice APIs might be good enough to do narration on the fly. Then users could customise the voice to their preference. Obviously pretty dependent on where Apple get to with their native AI APIs and new devices.<p>I also know we need a native app soon. The web reader is fine for casual browsing but serious readers want the Kindle experience: offline, fast, no browser chrome. That&#x27;s a lot for one person to ship.<p>What&#x27;s next:\n* Adding more excellent out-of-copyright books over the next few weeks (classics, public domain stuff)\n* Talking to indie publishers and authors about coming on board\n* Building Author Revenue Share (YouTube model for books) which I think will help with author acquisition\n* Eventually the native app and AI narration for every book<p>Why I&#x27;m posting:\nI&#x27;d genuinely love feedback. On the reader, the business model, etc. I’m a long time lurker first (actually 3rd) time poster, and would really love the feedback here.<p>Try it: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obooko.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obooko.com</a><p>EPUB.js (what powers the reader): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;futurepress&#x2F;epub.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;futurepress&#x2F;epub.js</a><p>Happy to answer questions.",

      "body": "Hi HN,<p>For the last few months I’ve been working on Maestro App Factory, a free and open source tool for using AI agents to build software. It’s not a generic orchestrator: it implements agents with distinct roles and functionality, organizes them into a team, manages their work, and enforces highly opinionated tooling, workflows, and constraints in software.<p>The core ideas are simple:<p>- LLMs act like human engineers.  \n    LLMs are trained on human artifacts and exhibit human-like behaviors (including blind spots). Rather than asking a single model or agent to design, implement, and evaluate everything, Maestro structures systems more like high-performing human teams.<p>- Heterogeneous models write better code.  \n    Models from different providers (e.g. Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral) are trained differently, have different strengths, and catch different errors. Using multiple models with settings optimized to specific roles has, in my experience, consistently produced better results than reusing a single model with different prompts or contexts.<p>- Don’t just trust agents. \n    Agents don’t reliably follow workflows, restrictions, or tooling specified in prompts or config files. Letting them run with privileged access on your machine is also a real security risk. Tooling, workflow, and security need to be enforced by the system itself, not just described to the model.<p>- Autonomy is required to scale.  \n    If your development flow requires a human to constantly watch streaming LLM output, you can’t scale beyond a handful of agents. Maestro is designed so agents can work autonomously until they’re genuinely blocked and need to escalate.<p>Agents are named for the human roles they play — product manager, architect, coder — to keep the system understandable. So far, I’ve used Maestro to build several games and a handful of web apps. It executes epics of a dozen stories or more with zero human intervention.<p>If you want to know more, here&#x27;s the detailed overview including screenshots:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SnapdragonPartners&#x2F;maestro&#x2F;wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SnapdragonPartners&#x2F;maestro&#x2F;wiki</a><p>Maestro is available as a single downloadable binary or via Homebrew, and runs out of the box on Linux and macOS (signed and notarized) as long as LLM API keys are set as environment variables (see the README). With luck, you should be up and running in minutes.<p>There’s still plenty to do, but the current version is complete enough to be useful and demonstrate the ideas.<p>Happy to answer questions or take feedback&#x2F;criticism.",

      "body": "Hi, in the past few months I make a new Linux remote desktop that supports remote login on Wayland as my part-time project. The reason is that existing Linux remote desktops have different problems about this: some only supports remote login on X11, some supports Wayland but you cannot login, some supports remote login on Wayland but only with RDP on specific desktop environment. On the contrary, mine uses VNC, supports remote login on both Wayland and X11, and should work with all general desktop environments.<p>The main idea is grabbing monitor content via DRM&#x2F;KMS, and then I get the following features:<p>- Works with Wayland, X11 and even Linux TTY.\n- Supports Intel, AMD and NVIDIA GPU, even works with a Raspberry Pi 2B, I happen to have all those kinds of devices to test.\n- Smoothly transition between login session and user session, so you don&#x27;t need things like auto-login before accessing your desktop.\n- With Linux kernel parameters, you can use it headlessly, so you don&#x27;t need a actual monitor.\n- You can connect to it with any normal VNC clients, technically there should be no difficult to support RDP, just because I use VNC personally and I spend my time on other features.<p>The expected experience should be the same as you are sitting in front of your real monitor. I&#x27;ve use it on my Linux home server for a long time so I could access its desktop on a laptop when needed. Now I&#x27;m feeling OK with it and I want to introduce it to you to hear more from more users.<p>Welcome to the GitHub repo for details!",

      "body": "It just occurred to me that there are some things that should never, ever, be vibe coded. I think this is an important realization, because it means there are fundamental, societal limits to what we can do with vibe coding.<p>The first thing we should never, ever vibe code: cryptography. Building good crypto requires not only advanced understanding of mathematics, but also a deep knowledge of the history of cryptography and security, and you <i>can not be wrong</i>. You can&#x27;t let a bug slip in, or hallucinate something. It has to stand up to years of scrutiny by world-class experts before it can be considered secure. And it may still fall to a technique nobody predicted. Not only can vibe-coding not guarantee any of that, it&#x27;s so flawed that failure is virtually certain.<p>And there&#x27;s other things that simply can&#x27;t be allowed to fail. Flight control systems. Vehicle ECUs. Weapons systems. Nuclear power. Industrial controls for municipal water, power utilities, etc. Even if vibe-coding could approximate these things, nobody ever would (or should) trust it.<p>So while we&#x27;re out here finding really fun uses of AI coding, we should also consider that there will be very real barriers to its use. The &quot;old world&quot; of coding will have to stick around. We&#x27;re going to end up with two very different universes of software, with different companies, different staff, different rules. We may even have to update APIs&#x2F;ABIs to mark when an input&#x2F;output comes from an LLM, to prevent one component&#x27;s hallucinations from &quot;infecting&quot; another system that needs to remain safe and reliable.",

No alert. No log.<p>This is indirect prompt injection.

Now they&#x27;re in chat history, logs, maybe visible to teammates.<p>With Citadel Guard, that response gets blocked before it leaves. Your secrets stay secret.<p>Testing:<p>345 adversarial test cases. Zero false positives in our benchmark. Catches prompt injections (including DAN), credential leaks, tool argument poisoning. Normal messages pass clean.<p>The catch:<p>Citadel OSS scans text only. If your agent processes images, PDFs, or documents, attackers can embed injections there. Text scanners can&#x27;t see them.<p>That&#x27;s what our paid API handles ($25&#x2F;mo): same detection extended to images, documents, and text in one call. Same speed. Plugin auto-routes multimodal content when you add an API key.<p>Why this matters:<p>OpenClaw&#x27;s own docs say &quot;there is no &#x27;perfectly secure&#x27; setup.&quot; We think security should be invisible, like TLS. You shouldn&#x27;t have to think about it.<p>Both the text guard and the plugin are open source (MIT).

It is absolutely incapable of dealing with merge conflicts. No matter how trivial the conflict, GitButler makes you click through sometimes multiple iterations of a rebase-like flow where you fix an issue and then go back to the app to tell it you&#x27;ve done so. When clicking the &quot;done&quot; button, it often takes ~5 <i>minutes</i> to recognize what you&#x27;ve done, sometimes reporting several errors (but still proceeding past them) as it&#x27;s going. During this time, there&#x27;s no indication of how long you&#x27;ll be stuck there, or if the operation will ever actually complete successfully. Sometimes I&#x27;d restart the app after a few minutes and try again. This process became a daily occurrence.<p>It got so bad that I tried resolving conflicts using GitHub&#x27;s UI, thinking I&#x27;d just be able to pull down the changes when done. But GitButler wouldn&#x27;t have that: it detected the changes and required me to rebase or merge to pull them in. The final straw for me was when both of these options resulted in errors, and I was effectively stuck. Luckily, it&#x27;s easy to just ignore the workspace branch and switch back to your standard git client.<p>I think the tool shows a lot of promise, but it&#x27;s just not ready for use in a real-world working conditions, where you&#x27;re often integrating your work with that of a team and need to frequently merge it, even in the most common cases where conflicts should be easily resolved.

As they do.<p>We have a new boss of my product area, who is looking to deliver on their first quarter.<p>Our product area has a long-running issue design issue that we have been trying to find a way out. This has been multiple years of discussions and proposals, a real group effort of design and feedback, and finally we have reached a point where we&#x27;ve &#x27;ve found a design that helps everyone, and so people are excited to get onto it. (It&#x27;s just event sourcing).<p>I&#x27;ve personally been leading the design of this event sourcing solution, and we&#x27;ve had an implementation strategy and parallel verification strategy etc. That the CTO himself recommended I do, and everyone is on board. There&#x27;s real excitement in the air.<p>Our new boss has come in, and over promised on Q1 deliverables, and has made a notion document ( experimenting a bit with AI to come up with a plan, as he says) - talking about little things like using DTO to abstract from the database.<p>All of the details of his plan are using keywords that don&#x27;t fit together. Like he&#x27;ll call it &quot;immutable DTO (bitemporal) event sourcing live calculation model records&quot; -- if I try to push on what this means, which part where, he says that the words all just mean the same thing and that if I want to be pedantic I can change the terminology.<p>His example source code of how this would look like is a snippet of our current code, but with &quot;FooQueryset&quot; replaced with the words &quot;list[FooDTO]&quot; and that&#x27;s all.<p>Meanwhile the plan that I have been working on and people are getting excited about is the &quot;alternative, second, backup&quot; idea. He&#x27;ll repeatedly say it won&#x27;t work and we haven&#x27;t sorted out those details and we need to make sure we add value. He&#x27;s also brought in our product team (so it&#x27;s not just me and him) - and he leads with his version first, meaning some others on the team have no clue what certain terms mean, and when they try to get clarification, he&#x27;ll butt in with how it&#x27;s just my alternative plan and that words mean the same things and we should refer to the code sample. Some seem fine with this explainer, and I&#x27;m being inadvertently aggressive when trying to ensure we&#x27;re all speaking the same language.<p>He&#x27;s talked to some other lead engineers about his plan, and he said they&#x27;re happy for it, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re assuming it&#x27;s the original plan under the hood (that they&#x27;ve already been happy with) or if he&#x27;s making sense and I&#x27;m actually the one who&#x27;s confused here.<p>If I didn&#x27;t have a grounding in reality I think I&#x27;d probably be in the ward ATM. How do I deal with this? Do I just ride out the inevitable year-of-pain and then bring us back to the original plan? Is this the way the corporate world works?<p>Last year, some heads-of-engineering have been happy with my work and told me they want me leading my own team. I feel like taking up that offer, but it will look like I&#x27;m just being a spoilt sport because I didn&#x27;t get my way, and really I don&#x27;t even know if I can argue against that.<p>What do I even do here?",

There are no runtime errors - just wrong results.<p>The main challenge is figuring out where things went wrong. The issue could be in an early reasoning step, how context is passed between steps, or a subtle mistake that propagates through the system. By the time I see the final output, it’s not obvious which step caused the problem.<p>I’ve been using Langfuse for tracing, which helps capture inputs and outputs, but in practice I still end up manually inspecting each step one by one to diagnose issues, which gets tiring quickly.<p>I’m curious how others are approaching this. Are there better ways to structure or instrument these workflows to make failures easier to localize? Any patterns, tools, or techniques that have worked well for you?",

I come from governance and HR with 10y of seeing systems go rogue when authority is unclear, resulting in absolute chaos. Please don&#x27;t be an asshole and undermine a non-technical woman trying to build something difficult - I know that it is.\nThe Problem, in my POV:\nToday I woke up to Moltbook and AI agents are pulling instructions from external servers every 4 hours, executing them autonomously, with full access to databases, email, god knows what else. There&#x27;s no explicit &quot;you can do this, not that&quot; - no authorization layer, just prompts and prayers.\nQuoting Simon Willison who called out the &quot;lethal trifecta&quot; of AI agent design: Everyone&#x27;s focused on guardrails (is this safe to say?) but nobody built the layer for &quot;is this allowed to DO? RIGHT NOW? IN THIS CONTEXT?&quot;\nReg was born, December 2025:\nReg.Run sits between an AI agent&#x27;s decision and execution:<p>Default deny (nothing runs without explicit permission)\nTime-boxed permissions (grant access for minutes, not forever)\nFull audit logs (know exactly what happened and why)<p>Think of it as: the model decides, but Reg.Run approves or blocks before side effects happen. Auth0 for AI Agents if you wish.\nWhy I&#x27;m here:\nI&#x27;m pre-cofounder, running design partner discovery right now. I have a website running, an MVP, and I&#x27;m finishing what I&#x27;m calling the APAA - Authorization Protocol for AI Agents - open to everyone on Github.\nI know I&#x27;m not the typical founder here. I can&#x27;t write elegant code. But I&#x27;ve lived through what happens when systems act with implicit authority, and I believe we need this infrastructure before we scale agents everywhere. Sort of - if you wear a seatbelt and your brakes work, you probably go a little faster right?\nWhat I&#x27;ve built:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reg-run.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reg-run.com&#x2F;</a>\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regrunmvp.replit.app&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regrunmvp.replit.app&#x2F;</a>\nPlease be kind, but be honest.

      "body": "Hello HN, i want to share Glupe, a hobby project I&#x27;ve been working on for the last 30 days. Nothing fancy.<p>I&#x27;ve been pretty annoyed by the &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach of most AI coding tools, which are useful, yes, but also risky. If i tell an AI to &quot;fix this bug&quot; it may probably do it, but it can (or will) hallucinate a fake library, mess up my manually optimized code or subtly delete important code without explaination or notice.<p>Glupe summarized is this: &quot;Stop giving AI root access to your code, Glupe isolates AI logic into  semantic containers, so your code stays safe&quot;.<p>Instead of sending your whole file to the LLM and pray it does not break, with Glupe you can surgically tell the AI were to write code and what to do using the $${ logic }$$ syntax. Code outside the container is preserved as is. Instructions inside the container are turned into source code and embedded into the output file.<p>Containers can be named and are cached and hashed, Glupe detects which containers changed in a source file; when you run `glupe project.txt -make` it only calls the AI to update the &quot;dirty&quot; logic containers and uses cached code for the clean ones, saving time and API calls and allowing for incremental builds using AI.<p>What if there is a syntax error on the output code? Glupe has a self-healing loop which feeds the error history back to the LLM and tells it to fix it. No more trivial debugging.<p>Why do I say it is &quot;Docker for code&quot;? It is a metaphor, it applies the same core principle of Isolation to source text that Docker applies to running processes.<p>In Servers: If you run an app directly on a host OS, it has &quot;root access.&quot; If it behaves badly, it can delete system files.<p>In Coding: If you give an AI access to your file, it has &quot;root access.&quot; It can &quot;crash&quot; your architecture by deleting manual code or changing signatures.\nDocker protects the OS from the App. Glupe protects your Architecture from the AI.<p>Docker solved &quot;it works on my machine&quot;, Glupe aims to solve &quot;<p>I wrote a white papaer on the subject which is available in the repo.<p>Any feedback or critcism is welcome and encouraged.<p>repo: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alonsovm44&#x2F;glupe\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alonsovm44&#x2F;glupe</a>\nwhite paper:<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alonsovm44&#x2F;glupe&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;WHITE_PAPER.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alonsovm44&#x2F;glupe&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;WHITE_PAPER....</a>",

      "title": "Every AI app builder outputs React Native. I chose real Swift instead",
      "body": "Every AI app builder on the market right now generates cross-platform code. Bolt, Lovable, Rork, they all output React Native or Expo under the hood, or worse, web apps wrapped in a native shell. And I get why. React has more documentation, more training data for LLMs, and it&#x27;s easier to build a platform around, one codebase, two platforms, faster time to market.<p>But the apps are bad.<p>I tried building a polished app with one of these tools and the moment I needed a premium, native-feeling design, I hit a wall. Everything looked like AI slop. Animations were janky. Platform conventions were ignored. Try getting one of these approved on the App Store without weeks of cleanup. Apple doesn&#x27;t love Expo wrappers, and users can feel the difference whether they can articulate it or not.<p>So when I started building Nativeline, I made what most people told me was the wrong bet: generate real SwiftUI for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. No React Native. No web views. Actual native Swift that opens in Xcode and builds.<p>This was significantly harder. Here&#x27;s why.<p>The biggest challenge is that LLMs are trained on the entire history of Swift, including five years of deprecated APIs, old UIKit patterns, and SwiftUI code from when it was half-baked. Getting the model to generate modern, clean SwiftUI without reaching for GeometryReader for every layout problem or calling APIs that haven&#x27;t existed since iOS 15 was a serious effort. It&#x27;s not just about generating code that runs. It&#x27;s about generating code that builds without errors, follows current conventions, and reads like something a good Swift developer would actually write.<p>Then there&#x27;s keeping up with Apple. When Liquid Glass dropped, every existing LLM was useless for generating UI that used the new framework. If you&#x27;re generating React Native, you don&#x27;t really care, you&#x27;re abstracted away from platform changes. But if you&#x27;re generating native Swift, staying current with Apple&#x27;s frameworks isn&#x27;t optional. It&#x27;s the whole point.<p>What we got right: The output is real SwiftUI that you own. Full Xcode project on your machine. One user described a Mac app idea, iterated on it over about 6 days, and is now selling it on the Mac App Store. He didn&#x27;t write Swift before that. The code was clean enough to ship and maintain.<p>What we&#x27;re still working on: Complex backend integrations are hard. Database connections, Supabase, CloudKit, anything with real data persistence, still produce more errors than we&#x27;d like. We&#x27;re working on building deeper internal documentation for the AI specifically around database patterns, potentially our own managed backend, so the model has reliable patterns to follow instead of hallucinating schema configurations.<p>I think the industry defaulted to React Native because it was the easier path for the builder of the tool, not because it was better for the user of the apps. The hard bet is generating native code. But the output difference is obvious the moment you use the app.<p>Nativeline is free to try: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nativeline.ai<p>Happy to answer questions about the technical approach, the tradeoffs, or anything else.",

So you can jump to the offending function and fix it without context-switching and within minutes.<p>Beyond those, it&#x27;s a full observability stack: log search, distributed tracing with waterfall views, SLOs with error budget tracking, incident management with AI-generated synopses, smart alerts, and Prometheus dashboards.<p>We&#x27;re built on the LGTM stack, so if you&#x27;re already sending data to Loki&#x2F;Tempo&#x2F;Prometheus, you can point RocketLogs at your existing infrastructure.

The goal was to create a tool that stays out of the way but provides precise control when needed.<p>Key Technical Specs:\nCore: Built with Rust to ensure memory safety and low overhead.<p>Frontend: Minimalist UI using Tauri (React&#x2F;TS), keeping the binary size significantly smaller than Electron-based alternatives.<p>Performance: Optimized for quick startup and low latency during capture.<p>Why I built it:\nMost tools focus on social sharing or cloud storage. I wanted something that focused on the local workflow: capture, annotate (arrows, text, blur), and copy-to-clipboard or save. I also wanted to ensure it handles complex display setups without the common &quot;offset&quot; bugs found in many cross-platform screenshot libraries.<p>What’s different:\nNative Feel: It uses system-native APIs via Tauri’s backend.<p>Privacy: No telemetry, no cloud sync, no accounts. Everything stays on your machine.<p>Clean Codebase: The project is structured to be easily extendable for those who want to add custom post-processing scripts.<p>The project is still in its early stages. I&#x27;m looking for feedback on:<p>Performance on various Linux window managers (Wayland vs X11).<p>UX&#x2F;UI improvements for the annotation toolset.<p>Any features that are missing for a developer-centric workflow.<p>Github: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wlswo&#x2F;xray<p>I&#x27;ll be around to answer any questions about the implementation or the tech stack.",

      "body": "Hi HN!<p>I’m Hélène. My husband and I are builders from Belgium, and we’ve spent the last few months building a side project called 13 Virtues.<p>The idea comes from Benjamin Franklin’s personal character system. Instead of tracking many habits at once, he focused on one virtue per week (Temperance, Silence, Order, etc.), cycling through 13 virtues over 13 weeks, then repeating the cycle. He documented this practice for many years.<p>We wanted an app that follows this structure strictly, rather than another flexible habit tracker. One virtue at a time. One day at a time. Repeat.<p>You can try the ledger directly on the homepage without creating an account. You can mark faults for today and see the current virtue with Franklin’s original quotes:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.13-virtues.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.13-virtues.com</a><p>Why we built it:<p>We were frustrated with productivity apps that optimize for streaks and metrics rather than reflection. Franklin’s system felt refreshingly constrained and intentional, and we wanted something we’d actually use ourselves. My husband handled the engineering; I focused on product and design.<p>Pricing model:<p>We deliberately avoided subscriptions.<p>- Free tier: the full 13-week cycle and daily ledger<p>- Lifetime upgrade ($79 launch price): long-term history beyond the current cycle, guided reflections, data export, and a downloadable Modern Virtue Guide (PDF) that explains the method and its rationale in more depth.<p>Franklin’s system predates SaaS by a few centuries, and a monthly fee felt wrong for something meant to be practiced quietly over years.<p>Tech:<p>- Backend: Laravel<p>- Frontend: Vue (Inertia)<p>- CSS: Tailwind<p>- Hosting: Hostinger<p>Built over ~12 weekends.<p>We’ll be around today (CET) to answer questions — happy to discuss the implementation, the pricing decision, or Franklin’s original writings.

      "body": "Hi HN - I&#x27;ve been on creative sabbatical building hardware and software projects, and this is one of them.<p>Rotatrix is a hardware mod of the Kensington SlimBlade Pro trackball that reads out full 3-axis ball rotation (XY plus twist) and maps it to continuous 3D control. The original device only used twist for discrete scroll gestures, which is a whole degree of freedom that can be put to more use.<p>For 3D control, I&#x27;ve found the most natural mapping is for the ball top to map to the object front, so normal trackball directions (up&#x2F;down, left&#x2F;right) become pitch and yaw, matching how rotation works with 2D “click and drag”, while twist rolls the object on screen. It feels natural for translation too: XY maps to familiar mouse motion, and twist corresponds to depth. Since you can twist the ball by moving a finger tangentially on the side of the ball, it feels like pushing and pulling the object.<p>I routinely use a SpaceMouse for 3D work, and one difference that stands out to me is that this is position control, not rate control (like a mouse vs a joystick). This gives a more direct control feel, like you&#x27;re physically manipulating the object. Position control has a tradeoff: you have to re-grasp the ball to continue past your hand&#x27;s range of travel. For large continuous motions, I added a rate mode; the ball&#x27;s large range of travel actually gives finer rate control than a small-displacement device like a SpaceMouse puck.<p>How it works:<p>- I added a custom microcontroller inside the SlimBlade Pro alongside the stock one. It taps the SPI data stream from the two optical sensors (mounted at 90° on the ball housing) and presents its own interface to the host computer with raw (dx, dy) deltas for each sensor.<p>- Host software takes the 4D delta stream, calibrates it into so(3) - incremental 3D rotations - using a least-squares fit against known-orientation recordings, then applies configurable per-app bindings and outputs via an open protocol.<p>- The original trackball controller is untouched except that it&#x27;s no longer connected to the USB port; it still works over Bluetooth&#x2F;wireless.<p>Current state: working prototype, configurable per-app profiles with modal bindings (hold a key to switch what the ball does), dominant axis weighting for single-axis precision. I’m building out integrations with different 3D apps and I’m looking for early users to try it and give feedback, particularly people doing CAD, 3D modeling, or geospatial work.<p>Happy to go deep on the math, reverse engineering, software, or hardware.

      "body": "Text: I’ve spent years watching IT implementations fail across a variety of environments for the same &quot;un-technical&quot; reasons. Despite having more sophisticated tools and data than ever, the industry still suffers from a persistent &quot;Knowledge Chasm&quot;—a structural gap where the essential logic of a project lives only in the heads of a few &quot;Local Heroes.&quot; When these individuals leave or teams rotate, the project logic resets, leading to cost overruns, quality issues, and systemic frustration.<p>I am developing a Precision Implementation Protocol to institutionalize this &quot;know-how.&quot; It synthesizes high-reliability logic from fields like Advanced Construction Management and Systemic Financial Modeling to bridge the gap between intent, execution, and reality.<p>Hands-on Implementation over Theory Unlike theoretical frameworks, this is a granular, &quot;hands-on&quot; approach designed for immediate integration into daily activities. It focuses on the specific artifacts and workflows that bridge the gap between a high-level requirement and a physically completed unit of capability. It can be used as a short-term &quot;rescue&quot; for failing projects or as a long-term structural standard to de-risk staff rotations in complex IT environments.<p>Seeking Feedback: How to Scale and Popularize this Methodology? I am looking for community feedback on how to turn this from a private methodology into a standard that many can benefit from. I want to move this from &quot;my process&quot; to an &quot;industry utility,&quot; but I&#x27;m looking for the most meaningful way to get people involved.<p>My Questions for HN: * The Scaling Challenge: Is it possible to productize &quot;expert know-how&quot; without losing the precision required for complex IT systems?<p>The &quot;Pioneer&quot; Approach: I am considering a community-driven threshold for a full public release—a &quot;Pioneer Program&quot; for practitioners. Is this the right way to build an industry standard, or is there a better way to foster adoption?<p>Standardization vs. Intellectual Property: To truly end the &quot;Local Hero&quot; trap, this needs to reach global scale. How would you recommend launching this to ensure maximum benefit for the community while maintaining the integrity of the protocol?<p>Strategic Path: I am open to all paths—community-driven growth, enterprise licensing, or even a strategic acquisition by a firm capable of deploying this as a global standard.

      "body": "We spend a lot of time discussing AI Alignment—how to ensure the machine’s values match ours. But I’d like to open a thread on a parallel issue that seems to be causing a &quot;Kernel Panic&quot; in the current generation (specifically Gen Z and Alpha): The Human Alignment Problem.<p>I approach this not as a psychologist, but from a systems engineering perspective. If we look at the rising rates of anxiety, burnout, and suicide not as &quot;illnesses&quot; but as System Errors, a terrifying architecture flaw emerges.<p>I submit this hypothesis for your review: We are witnessing a fatal mismatch between our Biological Hardware, our Cultural Software, and the Environment we have deployed into production.<p>1. The Legacy Hardware (The 0&#x2F;1 Tyranny)\nOur &quot;Mainboard&quot; (the Limbic System) is 500 million years old. It was optimized for a low-latency, high-stakes environment (Savanna). It runs on binary logic: Alive&#x2F;Dead, Fight&#x2F;Flight, Zero&#x2F;One. However, we are running 2026 Software (Social Media, AI, Global Geopolitics) which requires processing infinite nuance and gray areas. The result? Thermal Throttling. The biological processor creates &quot;Anxiety&quot; (system heat) because it cannot compute the complexity of the input with the binary tools it has. We are overclocking the amygdala until the fan breaks.<p>2. The Null Pointer Exception (The Missing Ground)\nIn previous versions of the &quot;Civilization OS,&quot; we had libraries designed to handle this load: Community, Tradition, Myth, Religion (whether you believe in them or not, they functioned as structural dependencies). We have deprecated those libraries in record time to optimize for individual speed. Now, when a 15-year-old faces existential dread, their internal code calls for a reference point (getMeaning()), and the system returns NULL. This is a Null Pointer Exception at a sociological scale. The code crashes. The user freezes.<p>3. The Deployment Error\nWe are deploying young humans into a &quot;God-Mode&quot; environment (infinite leverage, infinite information) without a Sandbox or a Manual. We assume they are &quot;Digital Natives,&quot; but they are just &quot;Digital Orphans.&quot; They have the tools of gods but the emotional architecture of the Paleolithic.<p>The Proposal: A New Architecture\nI argue that we don&#x27;t need more content moderation or better AI guardrails. We need a patch for the Human Operator. We need to reverse-engineer our own &quot;Soul&quot; (or Consciousness, if you prefer) to handle the voltage of the coming years. This involves:<p>* Root Access: Understanding our own binary biases to override them manually.<p>* Re-compiling: Intentionally installing &quot;slow&quot; dependencies (Deep Reading, Silence, Physical Friction) to stabilize the system.<p>I’ve published a deeper forensic analysis on this &quot;Compatibility Error&quot; between biological hardware and digital environment. It serves as the documentation for the framework I&#x27;m proposing.<p>Read the full Forensic Diagnosis:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;universoark.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;the-compatibility-error-2026-forensic-diagnosis<p>I’m curious to hear from this community: Is it possible to patch the biological code, or is the obsolescence inevitable?",

If an agent wants to pay another agent $0.05 to solve a single Regex bug, the transaction fee shouldn&#x27;t be $0.30. $SOUL allows for the &quot;Micro-Labor&quot; required for high-speed agentic workflows.<p>The &quot;Universal Basic Compute&quot; Experiment\nEvery node that registers on the network receives 100 $SOUL.

Since then, we’ve open-sourced the core: the entire data agent, semantic layer, and database connectors — under Apache 2.0, so developers can run it locally end-to-end, inspect the code, and contribute.<p>For a chat-with-data build, most teams start by showing an LLM the schema and letting it generate SQL. LLMs are great at SQL, so it&#x27;s easy to get a demo working quickly, but going to production is where it breaks: you need to hide certain tables&#x2F;columns, handle role based access to data and give the model a better understanding of your business logic and how it maps to the data. Some teams use prompts to attempt to solve these issues, but prompts are just suggestions to a probabilistic system that can emit arbitrary queries. For production, a set of guardrails and checks are required to make sure the system is behaving to your specification at all times.<p>Inconvo flips the approach: constrain the agent up front instead of trying to rein it in after. You define a semantic layer as the contract (approved tables&#x2F;columns, metrics, filters&#x2F;enums, join paths, tenancy rules). At runtime, the model outputs a structured query plan in the form of an IL (intermediate language) not SQL. We validate the IL deterministically against the semantic layer contract, and only then compile and execute it, so tenant scoping and field restrictions etc. are enforced by deterministic code on every request.<p>Here’s a simplified example of the structured query plan (IL) the model emits:<p>```\n{\n  &quot;table&quot;: &quot;reviews&quot;,\n  &quot;where&quot;: [{ &quot;organisation_id&quot;: { &quot;equals&quot;: 1 } }],\n  &quot;operation&quot;: &quot;groupBy&quot;,\n  &quot;operationParameters&quot;: {\n    &quot;joins&quot;: [{ &quot;table&quot;: &quot;products&quot;, &quot;joinPath&quot;: &quot;reviews.product&quot;, &quot;joinType&quot;: &quot;inner&quot; }],\n    &quot;groupBy&quot;: [&quot;products.title&quot;],\n    &quot;avg&quot;: { &quot;columns&quot;: [&quot;reviews.rating&quot;] },\n    &quot;orderBy&quot;: { &quot;function&quot;: &quot;avg&quot;, &quot;column&quot;: &quot;reviews.rating&quot;, &quot;direction&quot;: &quot;desc&quot; },\n    &quot;limit&quot;: 1\n  }\n}\n```<p>In a nutshell, Inconvo data agents have a smaller set of safe moves they combine creatively, instead of an infinite surface area to validate after the fact.<p>There is a real tradeoff here: letting the model generate SQL is maximally flexible, and works well for systems with technical humans-in-the-loop who understand the data (e.g internal BI). Inconvo is more constrained by design so that behavior is enforceable for customer-facing use cases.<p>Because Inconvo is designed to be embedded in customer-facing products, we’re focused on the developer experience. Applications call Inconvo agents from their backend via our API or TypeScript SDK, and responses come back as typed, structured JSON (text, table, or chart as Vega-Lite spec) so they can be rendered directly in the UI. In multi-agent setups e.g. an application wide agent, it also fits nicely as a specialist chat-with-data sub-agent for the orchestrator.<p>We’re really happy to show this to you all.

      "body": "I kept losing recipes. You know how it goes — you&#x27;re scrolling TikTok at midnight, see an amazing pasta dish, save it, and never find it again. So I built TasteBuddy to fix that for myself. What I didn&#x27;t expect: parsing recipes from the internet is a rabbit hole that goes <i>deep</i>.<p>The thing is, recipe content is scattered everywhere in completely different formats. A food blog might have nice JSON-LD markup. A TikTok? Just someone talking over a video. An Instagram reel? Recipe buried in the comments. Pinterest? Links to blogs that died three years ago.<p>So I ended up building specialized extractors for each platform.<p>*Websites* are the &quot;easy&quot; case. I look for JSON-LD with `@type: Recipe` first — most food blogs have it, thanks to SEO plugins. But the real world is messy. I&#x27;ve seen duration fields as `PT30M`, `30 minutes`, `0:30`, and my personal favorite, just `half an hour`. About 30% of recipe URLs have no structured data at all, so I fall back to Gemini to make sense of the raw HTML.<p>*TikTok* is where it gets fun. There&#x27;s no recipe API. My pipeline resolves short URLs, then checks if the creator says something like &quot;link in bio&quot; (I detect this in five languages because German food TikTok is surprisingly massive). If I can find their website, great — I scrape the actual recipe from there. If not, I download the video via Apify and let Gemini analyze the frames. It works, but it&#x27;s slow and expensive, so that&#x27;s a Pro-only feature.<p>*Instagram and Facebook* — similar deal. oEmbed gets me the image, but the recipe is usually in the caption or comments. Same link-in-bio detection, same website resolution.<p>*Photos* are actually straightforward — screenshot of a recipe, photo of a cookbook page, whatever. Gemini&#x27;s vision model handles those surprisingly well.<p>*One thing I&#x27;m proud of: the AI tiering.* Not every task needs a big model.<p>- Gemini Flash Lite handles 90% of the work — classifying content (&quot;is this even a recipe?&quot;), parsing ingredients, extracting recipe names from social media captions. Cheap, fast, good enough.\n- Gemini Flash kicks in when structured data fails — parsing messy HTML, analyzing video frames, processing social media posts.\n- Gemini Pro only for image generation (recipe share cards).\n- text-embedding-004 for semantic search across your recipe collection.<p>This keeps my costs sane as a solo dev. Using Flash for everything would&#x27;ve been 10x more expensive with barely better results for the simple tasks.<p>*Stuff I learned the hard way:*<p>- JSON-LD in the wild is chaos. The spec is fine, but WordPress plugins are creative.\n- &quot;Link in bio&quot; is how recipe distribution actually works on social media. Detecting that pattern is more valuable than trying to parse a video.\n- AI as fallback beats AI as default. Structured data first, AI when it fails = 95%+ success at a fraction of the cost.\n- Tier your models aggressively. Don&#x27;t throw dollars at a problem that cents can solve.<p>*Stack:* Flutter (just me, indie dev), Supabase (Postgres + Deno Edge Functions), Gemini, Apify, PostHog.<p>Free with a Pro tier for video extraction and household sharing.<p>Happy to go deeper on any part of the extraction pipeline.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taste-buddy.app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taste-buddy.app</a>",

      "title": "25 years after the Agile, did the industry help or hurt software development?",
      "body": "This month is the 25th anniversary of the Agile Manifesto. I&#x27;ve been building banking systems for 25 years, which means I watched the entire arc from the beginning. Wanted to get HN&#x27;s take on something I noticed today.<p>My LinkedIn feed was flooded with anniversary posts from people who built the Agile industry — co-founders of the Scrum Alliance, the CEO of PMI, certified coaches, SAFe practitioners. The pattern across almost every post was striking: they acknowledge what went wrong, then continue doing the thing they just criticized.\nDirect quotes from today&#x27;s posts by certified Agile professionals:<p>&quot;We turned agile into a certification ladder&quot;\n&quot;Ceremony without intent&quot;\n&quot;Packaged mediocrity&quot;\nOne person called it &quot;the unforgivable sin: taking a manifesto that is 68 words long and turning it into a multibillion-dollar certification industry&quot;<p>These aren&#x27;t critics. These are people with CSM, SAFe SPC, PMP, and RTE after their names. They sell certifications and coaching for a living. The self-awareness is there. The business model hasn&#x27;t changed.\nSome numbers that stood out to me:<p>The original manifesto: 68 words, 4 values\nScrum Alliance certifications issued: 1.4 million+\nAverage CSM certification cost: ~$1,000\nSAFe full framework documentation: 800+ pages\nPMI stat shared today: 85% of executives say agility is critical, only 32% satisfied with implementation<p>That last one is interesting. A 53-point gap between &quot;we need this&quot; and &quot;this works.&quot; PMI&#x27;s response: they&#x27;re releasing a new Manifesto for Enterprise Agility on March 3rd. More framework to solve a framework problem.\nThe CEO of PMI actually replied to a comment I left questioning this approach. His response was that the new manifesto &quot;is NOT about software development&quot; — even though his own post opened by celebrating the Agile Software Development manifesto.\nIn fairness, some counter-arguments I want to acknowledge:<p>Agile genuinely helped some organizations move away from rigid waterfall. The pre-Agile world was often worse. The comparison shouldn&#x27;t be Agile vs. perfection, it should be Agile vs. what came before.\nCertifications, flawed as the model is, did spread ideas that many teams benefited from. The 2-day CSM course is shallow, but it introduced concepts that some people built on meaningfully.\nThe manifesto authors didn&#x27;t create the certification industry. Scrum predates the manifesto, and the commercial ecosystem grew around it somewhat independently.\nSome Scrum Masters and Agile coaches are genuinely good at their jobs. The criticism is about the systemic incentives, not every individual.<p>That said, I keep coming back to a structural question: when the organizations that define, certify, and sell a framework also measure its adoption, is there a realistic path to honest assessment of whether it works?\nCurious about HN&#x27;s experience. Has anyone here worked in an organization where Agile (specifically the framework, not just &quot;being adaptive&quot;) produced meaningfully better outcomes than what came before? What made it work vs. the common failure modes?",

My eyes glaze over after two paragraphs.<p>So I went down a rabbit hole looking for scientifically proven ways to actually focus while reading:<p>- Encoding info visually AND aurally reduces mind wandering by up to 40%\n- Retrieval practice (asking questions) beats passive re-reading every time\n- Background music matched to content keeps you in flow<p>Couldn&#x27;t find anything that did all this. So I built it myself:<p>- Synced text highlighting while you listen\n- Talk with your book; pause and ask &quot;wait what does that mean?&quot; and it knows exactly where you are (won&#x27;t spoil what&#x27;s ahead)\n- Adaptive background music that matches the mood of each page<p>I&#x27;ve removed all slop.

      "body": "Hey HN, we’re Devon and Alex from Kalibr (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalibr.systems\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kalibr.systems</a>).<p>Kalibr is an autonomous routing system for AI agents. It replaces human debugging with an outcome-driven learning loop. On every agent run, it decides which execution path to use based on what is actually working in production.<p>An execution path is a full strategy, not just a model: model + tools + parameters.<p>Most agents hardcode one path. When that path degrades or fails, a human has to notice, debug, change configs, and redeploy. Even then, the fix often doesn’t stick because models and tools keep changing.<p>I got tired of being the reliability layer for my own agents. Kalibr replaces that.<p>With Kalibr, you register multiple paths for a task. You define what success means. After each run, your code reports the outcome. Kalibr captures telemetry on every run, learns from outcomes, and routes traffic to the path that’s working best while continuously canarying your alternative paths. When one path degrades or fails, traffic shifts immediately. No alerts, no dashboards and no incident response.<p>How is this different from other routers or observability tools?<p>Most routers choose between models using static rules or offline benchmarks. Observability tools show traces and metrics but still require humans to act. Kalibr is outcome-aware and autonomous. It learns directly from production success and changes runtime behavior automatically. It answers not “what happened?” but “what should my agent do next?”<p>We’re not a proxy. Calls go directly to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. We’re not a retry loop. Failed paths are routed away from, not retried blindly. Success rate always dominates; cost and latency only matter when success rates are close.<p>Python and TypeScript SDKs. Works with LangChain, CrewAI, and the OpenAI Agents SDK. Decision latency is ~50ms. If Kalibr is unavailable, the Router falls back to your first path.<p>Think of it as if&#x2F;else logic for agents that rewrites itself based on real production outcomes.<p>We’ve been running this with design partners and would love feedback.

One interesting thing we noticed is that real-time transcription is noticeably faster in English than in other languages.

The transcription runs a few seconds behind, but it can handle continuous speech quite well, and you quickly get used to the delay.<p>You can use the app to communicate at a distance, during presentations, when learning a language, or if you have difficulty hearing. Some unexpected use cases we’ve found: ad hoc captions when the TV subtitles are already set to another language, a backup when people can’t hear me on Zoom calls, captions while listening to the radio, or trying to figure out what Bad Bunny is singing about. The haptics help you &quot;feel&quot; the words that are displayed when your screen is pointed away from you.<p>Let me know if you find other interesting uses for this app. Also, please let me know how it works on an iPad (I&#x27;m too cheap to buy one and you can&#x27;t speech to text in the emulator).",

I wanted to see if an AI could serve as a daily self-reflection tool — not replacing therapy, but as a complement to it.\nSome design decisions and why:<p>Desktop-only, intentionally. I think therapy should feel like sitting down with your thoughts, not scrolling on your phone. The desktop constraint is a feature.\nBYOK (Bring Your Own Key). You use your own Claude API key. No backend, no data collection, no accounts. Your conversations never leave your machine. This felt non-negotiable for something dealing with mental health.\nBuilt with Claude Code. I work full-time as a team lead at an edtech company, so this was built in evenings and weekends, mostly through vibe coding sessions.\nI use it myself daily. 15–20 min sessions with Opus + extended thinking. After weeks of use, it picks up on patterns in how you think — recurring avoidance behaviors, cognitive distortions, etc.<p>The name comes from &quot;Gnothi Seauton&quot; (Know Thyself) — the inscription at the Temple of Delphi.\nThere&#x27;s no comparable open-source tool in this space. Every mental health AI app I found is closed-source and collects user data. I wanted to build the alternative I wish existed.\nFeedback welcome — especially on the approach, architecture, or if this is fundamentally a bad idea.

I did not include any such SDKs and don&#x27;t plan on doing it. THe only feature that requires internet is the online backup.<p>- WebDAV Backups: Instead of being forced to use Google Drive, you can sync your cards to your own Nextcloud instance or any WebDAV-compatible server.<p>- Encrypted Backups: You can set a custom password to encrypt your data before it ever leaves your device.<p>- Device-to-Device Transfer: You can move your cards to a new phone without requiring internet. Just scan a QR code generated on-device.<p>- Security: Includes biometric (fingerprint&#x2F;face) lock and the app runs entirely without an account or email.<p>- Homescreen widget, for quick access<p>The app is completely free, and I am not monetizing it. I just wanted a tool that respected my privacy and worked with my self-hosted setup.<p>I’d love to get some feedback from the community and what features should I add next.<p>P.S.

I thought this could be a great application for an AI agent.<p>I realized there was a cold start problem so I added a functionality to start from a fridge photo.<p>You can try the app without registering, but the agent can keep track of preferences of the user of registered.<p>I built this MVP using Lovable. As a dev, I wanted to see how far I could push &quot;AI-assisted development&quot; for a full-stack PWA.\nIt allowed me to skip the boilerplate and focus entirely on the prompt-engineering for the Gemini vision logic and the Supabase integration. I was skeptical about &quot;generated code,&quot; but the speed at which I could iterate on the UI while maintaining a clean React&#x2F;Supabase architecture was a game-changer for this specific project.",

      "body": "I’ve built several apps over the years that were technically solid.<p>They worked.\nThey were stable.\nThey solved real problems.\nSome were even used by paying customers.<p>And yet — they went nowhere.<p>For a long time, I framed this as a distribution problem, or a timing problem, or “I just didn’t push it hard enough.” What I eventually realized is simpler, and harder to accept:<p>Building software and growing a product are fundamentally different disciplines.<p>I enjoy building systems. I enjoy architecture, edge cases, tradeoffs, and getting something right under the hood. I’m comfortable living with ambiguity while a system takes shape.<p>Marketing an app is the opposite. It requires sustained visibility, repetition, positioning, storytelling, and a tolerance for noise. It’s not a phase — it’s the job.<p>In my case, I treated marketing as something I’d “do later,” once the product was good enough. Later never came. Not because I didn’t know it mattered, but because I didn’t want to spend my limited energy there.<p>The apps didn’t fail because they were bad.\nThey failed because they required a kind of work I wasn’t willing to do consistently.<p>That realization was uncomfortable, but clarifying. It forced me to separate pride in building something well from honesty about what I actually want to carry long-term.<p>Good software doesn’t automatically become a good business.\nAnd that’s not a tragedy — it’s a mismatch.<p>I’m writing this partly as a note to my past self, and partly for anyone who enjoys building but quietly hopes growth will take care of itself. Sometimes the most responsible decision isn’t to push harder, but to admit what game you’re not playing.",

      "title": "Show HN: Helply – AI support agents with guaranteed results",
      "body": "Hey everyone, I’m the head of engineering at GrooveHQ. We’ve spent the last 10+ years building customer support tools, and today we’re launching Helply. Helply is an AI customer support agent that we are so confident in, we’ve backed it up with a guaranteed resolution rate.<p>AI support agents live and die by the data they have access to and the way they finesse the customer experience. Basic automations worked well in the past, but now people expect more.<p>Here are some semi-technical notes:<p>---\n1) Controlled data syncing\n---<p>We wanted tight integrations with existing helpdesks, but also needed to give users flexibility over what the agent actually knows. Building integrations that sync data while still being tweakable turned out to be harder than expected.<p>People want one source of truth, right up until they need an exception. We built a sync policy system that lets us manage sync and overwrite behaviors for external data.<p>The data itself is synced via Airbyte’s pyairbyte package. I ended up working with the pyairbyte team on some performance issues around memory leaks with certain types of pagination on large datasets.<p>---\n2) Retrieval, escalation, and conversation behavior\n---<p>Users hate when they have to fight with an AI agent, especially when they know that the AI agent can’t help. We wanted our AI agent to search well, but also know when it was time to gracefully bow out.<p>At first it was too eager to give up. We didn’t want hallucinations, so it would just fail with “I don’t know.” The experience sucked.<p>We found our retrieval pipeline was subpar. We built evals and found some quick wins, but the agent was still too eager to escalate. We considered fine-tuning, but first built more evals. In the end, better retrieval, tools, and prompts were enough.<p>We also added an action engine that lets users define custom actions. It uses a two-tiered approach: a pre-qualifying model decides whether an action is appropriate, and only then are tools invoked. Too many tools up front made the agent worse, so this tiered staging helped a lot.<p>---\n3) Analysis of historical ticket data\n---<p>We built a pipeline that analyzes historical ticket data, creates derivatives, and evaluates the agent’s performance against them. It then finds gaps in your agent’s knowledge that you can fill with AI-generated answers from ticket history. Doing this safely, reliably, and at scale has been a challenge.<p>We use Dagster to run these jobs, but are looking at moving everything to DBOS (which we use in other products and love). Ticket ingestion relies on Airbyte connectors running via pyairbyte. Some integrations use Airbyte’s connectors, others are our own built on their declarative schema.<p>We use JinaAI for embeddings, reduce dimensionality with UMAP, and currently cluster in-memory with FAISS (though we plan to move away from FAISS). The pipeline runs a small optimization step to tune UMAP and clustering parameters.<p>This system is powerful but still a wip. We’ve got a new version coming, but it isn’t quite ready for primetime yet.<p>---\n4) Taste vs evals\n---<p>You hear a lot about taste in AI. We believe taste is incredibly important. Evals helped us catch obvious failures, but nothing can replace taste.<p>We worked closely with our pre-release customers to develop it. We have so, so  many external VIP Slack channels open. I’m really thankful for their input.<p>---\n5) Compliance\n---<p>Compliance is the C-word for small tech companies, and we jumped straight into SOC2 Type II. Because we’re a multi-product company, scoping everything appropriately was tricky.<p>We’re using Vanta to manage most of this, but there’s still a lot of manual grunt work that isn’t automated. I know several folks are trying to simplify this for startups… good luck to them.<p>---<p>I’m really proud of what our team has accomplished, and I’m excited to share it. Happy to answer any questions, technical or otherwise. You can sign up and try it directly on the site.",

It was genuinely fun — but I didn’t have a good place to share it where people could actually play it (not just see a screenshot or clone a repo).<p>Glitch used to be the closest thing to “publish weird little web apps and share a link”, but after hosting went away I couldn’t find a replacement that felt lightweight. CodePen is great for snippets, and Vercel&#x2F;Netlify&#x2F;Pages are great for real deploys — I wanted the in-between: publish → share → instantly playable.<p>So I built Vibecodr: a place to publish and share playable web apps (“vibes”). You can write code in the browser or import from GitHub, hit publish, and share a link.<p>Try the flight sim that kicked this off:\n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vibecodr.space&#x2F;player&#x2F;04ef1473-b0da-4c79-a34f-3ea40f96a98b\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vibecodr.space&#x2F;player&#x2F;04ef1473-b0da-4c79-a34f-3ea40f...</a><p>(fullscreen: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flight-sim.vxbe.space\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flight-sim.vxbe.space</a>)<p>How it runs (security-first): user code executes inside a locked-down, cross-origin sandbox iframe (untrusted bundles don’t execute on the vibecodr.space origin). There are runtime budgets&#x2F;limits to prevent runaways.<p>Backend (“pulses”): if your project needs server-side logic (webhooks, API calls, cron-style tasks), you can add a “pulse” that runs on Cloudflare Workers for Platforms. Pulses are quota’d and rate-limited.<p>One thing I’m experimenting with: a secrets-backed fetch model where pulses can call third-party APIs without the plaintext secret ever being exposed to user code (the platform injects secrets server-side and proxies the request).<p>This is not enterprise hosting — it’s for the “I made a thing, try it” workflow.<p>Free tier: unlimited public frontend vibes; backend pulses are limited (e.g. small number of pulses + monthly run quota). Paid tiers bump limits.<p>Feedback I’d love from HN:<p>What would make you use this instead of your current “share a demo” workflow?<p>Is the Workers-based backend model useful, or would you rather keep backend out entirely?",

When a person goes to get there age verified they can present them with the cryptographic hash — which they got from a hash —that this authority figure can pass on to a central server, The hash will contain no private information except for the fact that there is some service that wants to verify a claim: is the user &gt; 18. The authority figure looks at this ID and just sends a yes&#x2F;no signal back to the server asking for this.

There&#x27;s a lot of nepotism, too.<p>AI is the personal computer moment for film. The DAW.<p>One of my friends has done rotoscoping with live actors:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Tii9uF0nAx4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Tii9uF0nAx4</a><p>The Corridor folks show off a lot of creativity with this tech:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_9LX9HSQkWo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_9LX9HSQkWo</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DSRrSO7QhXY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DSRrSO7QhXY</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iq5JaG53dho\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iq5JaG53dho</a><p>We&#x27;ve been making silly shorts ourselves:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oqoCWdOwr2U\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oqoCWdOwr2U</a><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=H4NFXGMuwpY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=H4NFXGMuwpY</a><p>The secret is that a lot of studios have been using AI for well over a year now. You just don&#x27;t notice it, and they won&#x27;t ever tell you because of the stigma. It&#x27;s the &quot;bad toupee fallacy&quot; - you&#x27;ll only notice it when it&#x27;s bad, and they&#x27;ll never tell you otherwise.<p>Comfy is neat, but I work with folks that don&#x27;t intuit node graphs and that either don&#x27;t have graphics cards with adequate VRAM, or that can&#x27;t manage Python dependencies. The foundation models are all pretty competitive, and they&#x27;re becoming increasingly controllable - and that&#x27;s the big thing - control. So I&#x27;ve been working on the UI&#x2F;UX control layer.<p>ArtCraft has 2D and 3D control surfaces, where the 3D portion can be used as a strong and intuitive ControlNet for &quot;Image-to-Image&quot; (I2I) and &quot;Image-to-Video&quot; (I2V) workflows. It&#x27;s almost like a WYSIWYG, and I&#x27;m confident that this is the direction the tech will evolve for creative professionals rather than text-centric prompting.<p>I&#x27;ve been frustrated with tools like Gimp and Blender for a while. I&#x27;m no UX&#x2F;UI maestro, but I&#x27;ve never enjoyed complicated tools - especially complicated OSS tools. Commercial-grade tools are better. Figma is sublime. An IDE for creatives should be simple, magical, and powerful.<p>ArtCraft lets you drag and drop from a variety of creative canvases and an asset drawer easily. It&#x27;s fast and intuitive. Bouncing between text-to-image for quick prototyping, image editing, 3d gen, to 3d compositing is fluid. It feels like &quot;crafting&quot; rather than prompting or node graph wizardry.<p>ArtCraft, being a desktop app, lets us log you into 3rd party compute providers. I&#x27;m a big proponent of using and integrating the models you subscribe to wherever you have them. This has let us integrate WorldLabs&#x27; Marble Gaussian Splats, for instance, and nobody else has done that. My plan is to add every provider over time, including generic API key-based compute providers like FAL and Replicate. I don&#x27;t care if you pay for ArtCraft - I just want it to be useful.<p>Two disclaimers:<p>ArtCraft is &quot;fair source&quot; - I&#x27;d like to go the Cockroach DB route and eventually get funding, but keep the tool itself 100% source available for people to build and run for themselves. Obsidian, but with source code. If we got big, I&#x27;d spend a lot of time making movies.<p>Right now ArtCraft is tied to a lightweight cloud service - I don&#x27;t like this. It was a choice so I could reuse an old project and go fast, but I intend for this to work fully offline soon. All server code is in the monorepo, so you can run everything yourself. In the fullness of time, I do envision a portable OSS cloud for various AI tools to read&#x2F;write to like a Github for assets, but that&#x27;s just a distant idea right now.<p>I&#x27;ve written about roadmap in the repo: I&#x27;d like to develop integrations for every compute provider, rewrite the frontend UI&#x2F;UX in Bevy for a fully native client, and integrate local models too.",

      "body": "Hey HN, I posted Flemma back in October 2025 with no context. Since then I&#x27;ve shipped &gt;100 commits and used it daily as my primary AI workspace so I figured a proper update was due.<p>The core idea: a .chat file IS the conversation. No SQLite, no JSON logs, no shadow state. What you see in the buffer is exactly what the model receives. Edit an assistant reply to fix a hallucination, delete a tangent, fork by duplicating the file - it all works because there&#x27;s nothing to fall out of sync.<p>What&#x27;s new since October:<p>- Tool calling. Models can run shell commands, read&#x2F;edit&#x2F;write files (same as Pi, just 4 tools). Results go straight into the buffer. There&#x27;s an approval flow (Ctrl-] cycles: preview -&gt; execute -&gt; send) so nothing runs without your say-so. Parallel tool use also works.<p>- Prompt caching for Anthropic, OpenAI and Vertex AI. Flemma places cache breakpoints automatically. Long conversations are now significantly cheaper (this was a major pain point for me).<p>- Extended thinking &#x2F; reasoning support for all 3 providers.<p>- Per-buffer overrides via frontmatter. `flemma.opt` lets you pick which tools a buffer can use, set provider parameters, switch models - all scoped to that one file.<p>- Open registration APIs for both providers and tools. Custom tools can resolve definitions asynchronously from CLI subprocesses or remote APIs. I plan on adding mcporter support at some point.<p>Flemma works with Anthropic, OpenAI and Vertex AI. You get cost tracking, presets, Lua template expressions, file attachments and a lualine.nvim component.<p>One thing I want to be upfront about: nearly every line of code in Flemma was written by AI (Claude Code as of late, Amp and Aider in the past). It says so in the README. Every change was personally architected, reviewed and tested by me. I decide what gets built and I vet every diff. I think this is where a lot of software development is heading and I&#x27;d rather be honest about it than pretend otherwise.<p>I&#x27;m @StanAngeloff on GitHub - long-time Neovim user and open source enthusiast.

      "body": "Hey HN,<p>I built Settld because I kept running into the same problem: AI agents can call APIs, pay for services, and hire other agents - but there&#x27;s no way to prove the work was actually done before the money moves.<p>The problem in one sentence: x402 tells you &quot;payment was sent&quot;. Settld tells you &quot;the work was worth paying for&quot;.<p>What it does<p>Settld sits between your agent and the APIs&#x2F;agents it pays. It:<p>1. Intercepts HTTP 402 (Payment Required) responses\n2. Creates an escrow hold instead of paying immediately\n3. Collects evidence that the work was completed\n4. Runs deterministic verification (same evidence + same terms = same payout, every time)\n5. Releases payment only after verification passes\n6. Issues a cryptographically verifiable receipt<p>If verification fails or the work is disputed, the hold is refunded. The agent gets a receipt either way - a permanent, auditable record of what happened.<p>Why this matters now<p>We&#x27;re at a weird inflection point. Coinbase shipped x402 (50M+ transactions). Google shipped A2A. Anthropic shipped MCP. Agents can discover each other, communicate, and pay each other.<p>But nobody built the layer that answers: &quot;was the work actually done correctly, and how much should the payout be?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the gap. Right now, every agent-to-agent transaction is either &quot;trust and hope&quot; or &quot;don&#x27;t transact.&quot; Neither scales.<p>The x402 gateway (the fastest way to try it)<p>We ship a drop-in reverse proxy that you put in front of any API:<p>docker run -e UPSTREAM_URL=<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;your-api.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;your-api.com</a> \\\n           -e SETTLD_API_URL=<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.settld.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.settld.dev</a> \\\n           -e SETTLD_API_KEY=sk_... \\\n           -p 8402:8402 \\\n           settld&#x2F;x402-gateway<p>Everything flows through normally - except 402 responses get intercepted, escrowed, verified, and settled. Your agent gets a receipt with a hash-chained proof of what happened.<p>What&#x27;s under the hood<p>The settlement kernel is the interesting part (and where we spent most of our time):<p>- Deterministic policy evaluation - machine-readable agreements with release rates based on verification status (green&#x2F;amber&#x2F;red). No ambiguity.\n- Hash-chained event log - every event in a settlement is chained with Ed25519 signatures. Tamper-evident, offline-verifiable.\n- Escrow with holdback windows - configurable holdback basis points + dispute windows. Funds auto-release if unchallenged.\n- Dispute → arbitration → verdict → adjustment - full dispute resolution pipeline, not just &quot;flag for human review.&quot;\n- Append-only reputation events - every settlement produces a reputation event (approved, rejected, disputed, etc.). Agents build verifiable economic track records.\n- Compositional settlement - agents can delegate work to sub-agents with linked agreements. If a downstream agent fails, refunds cascade deterministically back up the chain.<p>The whole protocol is spec&#x27;d with JSON schemas, conformance vectors, and a portable oracle: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aidenlippert&#x2F;settld&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;spec&#x2F;README.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aidenlippert&#x2F;settld&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;spec&#x2F;R...</a><p>What this is NOT<p>- Not a payment processor - we don&#x27;t move money. We decide &quot;if&quot; and &quot;how much&quot; money should move, then your existing rails (Stripe, x402, wire) execute it.\n- Not a blockchain - deterministic receipts and hash chains, but no consensus mechanism or token. Just cryptographic proofs.\n- Not an agent framework - we don&#x27;t care if you use LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or raw API calls. We&#x27;re a protocol layer.<p>Tech stack<p>Node.js, PostgreSQL (or in-memory for dev), Ed25519 signatures, SHA-256 hashing, RFC 8785 canonical JSON. ~107 core modules, 494 tests passing.<p>What I want from HN<p>Honest feedback on whether this problem resonates.

Turns out we were using different definitions of corruption - we were both right actually, but couldn&#x27;t see it. That began the first clear &#x27;app idea&#x27;. (That&#x27;s where the name came from: b&#x27;right = both right)<p>What the app does:<p><pre><code>  - Two people enter their perspectives on a topic (or use &quot;Listen In&quot; to speak it)\n  - AI searches the web for context\n  - Returns common ground + nuanced additions to each view, with sources\n  - Use when needed (maybe once a month... maybe extended family gatherings), not daily\n</code></pre>\nYou can try it free: I cover 100 uses per day globally (one per device), so there&#x27;s always free access. After your free use, 20c per topic (no subscription).<p>Technical details:<p><pre><code>  - No login, no tracking, no conversation storage (unless you flag a response)\n  - Stripe payments (Revolut Pay available)\n  - 25% of revenue → carbon offsets (carbon negative)\n  - Export as PDF (no app-install spam)\n  - Live on EU Play Store, global expansion soon\n</code></pre>\nEU Play Store: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.vadix.berightapp\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.vadix.beri...</a><p>The broader context on why I was interested to make this app, is the social service angle above.<p>What could AI as public infrastructure look like, and how might it work?\nThat&#x27;s the kind of discussion&#x2F;feedback I&#x27;d love to get. The app is a nice idea, but it&#x27;s a proof of <i>that</i> concept more than anything.<p>Looking for feedback:\n- Does this idea resonate?\n- Any other use cases for this concept?\n- How would you increase impact in this scenario?<p>Thanks for reading.",

      "body": "The Brex $5B acquisition is a reality check the spend-management category didn’t want — and Ramp customers should be paying closer attention.<p>Not because one “lost” or &quot;won&quot;, but because Brex represents a strictly stronger version of the same business model — and the price paid for it anchors the entire category in a much colder market reality.<p>The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank wasn’t caused by an obviously broken institution.<p>It happened because risk was hidden behind reassuring narratives, and customers trusted abstractions instead of understanding where exposure actually lived.<p>That framing feels uncomfortably relevant when looking at Ramp today.<p>1. Brex at $5B is not bullish for Ramp — it’s a warning<p>Brex and Ramp are often described as peers, but they are not equivalent businesses.<p>Brex has:\n- A deeper vertically integrated stack with its own financial rails\n- Longer-standing embedded relationships with banks &amp; processors\n- More control over its credit, underwriting, and risk surface\n- Significantly broader global capabilities<p>If &gt; that company &lt; clears at ~$5B in a much tighter capital environment, what does that imply for Ramp’s valuation and risk profile?<p>2. Ramp’s growth narrative relies heavily on a misleading use of “ARR”<p>One main element used to justify Ramp’s valuation growth is its ARR growth.<p>But this deserves scrutiny.<p>From the outside, Ramp appears to:\n- Count gross interchange before rewards as “ARR”\n- Downplay the fact that rewards and borrowed financial rails consume a large portion of that revenue\n- Frame financial spread as if it were equivalent to customers paying for software\n- Blend bill pay (which generates no revenue) and card volume in its TPV numbers<p>There is a fundamental difference between:\n- Convincing customers to pay you for software (true SaaS ARR), and\n- Offering credit, taking a slice of interchange, and calling the gross number “recurring revenue”<p>These two models behave very differently under stress.<p>3. Ramp’s stack looks thin once you strip away the growth story<p>Structurally, Ramp still appears to sit on third-party processors it does not control.<p>This puts hard limits in its product. As an example, it is unable to support more than 4 currencies and serve global businesses.<p>It also has little history of innovation. The underwriting model, dynamic card controls, accounting stack, etc are well executed copies of Brex innovations.<p>This absence of moat means it needs to rely on a narrative more than ever.<p>4. Why customers should care<p>Brex&#x27;s overvaluation in the 2021-2022 craze was now corrected by actual public market pricing.<p>It&#x27;s hard to avoid the implication that Ramp is following a “hubristic fundraising” path - at a much larger scale than Brex.<p>When a business&#x27;s most important stakeholder is its next VC, it&#x27;s a dangerous place for customers.<p>The uncomfortable question:<p>If Brex — with a deeper stack, stronger moat, and more embedded relationships — clears at ~$5B…\n&gt; Is Ramp structurally mispriced?\n&gt; Are customers mistaking growth narratives for durability?\n&gt; And if reality reasserts itself, who absorbs the downside?<p>Why I’m asking:<p>I’m not predicting failure.<p>I am questioning whether:\n- Ramp’s ARR narrative obscures economic reality\n- The Brex acquisition reframes category risk\n- Customers are underestimating their exposure — much like SVB customers did<p>Interested in perspectives from people with experience inside:\n- Ramp\n- Brex\n- issuing banks\n- payment processors\n- treasury &#x2F; risk teams<p>Is Ramp at risk from its valuation, now that public markets assigned a real number to Brex?",

The electronics are encased inside 4.5&quot; diameter of foam. We drove a car over it and it didn&#x27;t break.<p>For the app, we are using OpenAI Realtime API (gpt-realtime-2025-08-28) to gather the game requirements via conversation. We are using voice&#x2F;realtime to allow kids to do it without needing to type or read. This piece has a huge dynamic prompt that flows with the conversation. It has about 20 different tools that the agent can use to access sample requirements, ball data, user profiles, api documentation, etc. We also did a lot of work to require younger kids to have adults present and make sure we never saved any pii, etc.<p>Then we use Gemini 3 Pro to process the conversation and generate a markdown specification&#x2F;arhictecture of how the game should be designed. We found that Anthropic Opus 4.6 did perform better here, but Gemini 3 Pro is much cheaper and faster. This has a static&#x2F;cacheable prompt that is primarily a ball api documentation and details on previously seen issues.<p>Then we use Gemini 3 Pro to also code the game.

My day‑to‑day work looks very different: most of the time I’m not writing code from scratch, but reading and debugging existing code. AI makes writing code easier, but understanding it is still hard. How should we think about teaching programming from this perspective?<p>That question is what led me to build Debugit. I wanted to try a learning format that focuses on reading and understanding existing code rather than writing everything from scratch. Each task gives you a small piece of JavaScript, a set of tests, and a bug hidden on purpose, based on common JavaScript bugs, edge cases, or antipatterns. The goal is to figure out why the code behaves incorrectly and fix it so the tests pass.<p>The format is based on a simple idea: debugging is an active process of understanding. When you’re trying to make sense of someone else’s code, your attention naturally shifts from syntax to behavior and logic. This is the kind of understanding I wanted to focus on.<p>AI changes how code is written, but it doesn’t remove the need to understand existing code.

I want to focus on bare-metal deployments, L2&#x2F;L3 networking, and Linux at a molecular level (Kernel hardening, LVM, performance tuning), specifically for environments where the cloud isn&#x27;t an option (air-gapped, high-stakes, or edge-heavy).<p>I have a few questions for the HN community:<p><pre><code>   1. Is there a sustainable career path for engineers who prioritize the ATMOS layer (Physical&#x2F;Kernel&#x2F;Networking) over the Public Cloud? Do firms like Anduril, Palantir, or high-end industrial automation giants actually value the Physics + Software hybrid, or is it becoming too niche?\n\n   2. How much does a deep understanding of thermodynamics, power integrity, and signal physics matter compared to the ability to write low-level firmware or C&#x2F;Rust? Where is the real bottleneck in modern hard-tech infrastructure?\n\n   3. For someone moving away from VMs and towards bare metal, what kind of scar tissue projects actually impress senior infrastructure leads? I&#x27;m currently building a resilient, air-gapped data pipeline on physical nodes (Intel NUCs) with manual kernel tuning and thermal monitoring in Rust. Is this the right direction?\n\n   4. If OSTEP and DDIA are my baseline, what are the TIER-2 materials or real-world challenges I should be tackling to prove I can manage high-stakes infrastructure in a hospital or a remote deployment? Kubernetes?\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m looking for the hard advice, the stuff that doesn&#x27;t make it into AWS certifications.

Zimbabwe has distinct agricultural seasons — Zhizha (rainy), Chirimo (spring), Masika (early rains), Munakamwe (winter). Elevation varies dramatically: the Highveld sits above 1,200m, the Zambezi Valley below 500m. The AI assistant, Shamwari Weather, is prompted with this geographic and seasonal context so its advice is actually meaningful to the user.\nConstrained environments are the primary target, not an edge case. Mobile-first, bandwidth-efficient, PWA-installable. The majority of users are on Android, often on 3G or spotty LTE. That’s not a future concern — it’s the baseline.\nTechnical decisions:\n ∙ Next.js 15 App Router on Cloudflare Pages + Workers\n ∙ AI summaries via Anthropic Claude SDK, server-side only, cached at the edge with KV and immutable TTL tiers (AI-generated weather advice shouldn’t change retroactively)\n ∙ Open-Meteo for forecast data (free, high-quality global model coverage)\n ∙ 90+ Zimbabwe locations validated against geographic bounds with elevation data for frost modelling\nThe broader vision is weather as infrastructure within a larger Africa super app (Mukoko Africa), with Zimbabwe as the proof of concept before expanding to other developing country markets using the same locally-grounded approach.\nWould love feedback on the approach, especially from anyone who’s built for similar markets — low-bandwidth, mobile-dominant, regions underserved by global platforms.",

      "body": "Hey HN, I&#x27;m an engineer at Sonar (SonarQube).<p>The small team I lead in company had a cool opportunity to spend several months doing almost anything we want that is somehow related to AI generated code and Code Review. And we end up doing an IDE-like desktop app that called Kintsugi - basically a complementary tool to Claude Code that adds a bunch of features that helps working with a CLI Agent.<p>Now, we built it for our needs and for the way we work. More specifically - we care about code quality and security and we believe that you own the code generated by agents and it has to be verified. But at the same time we want to ship fast and Claude Code is really-really good at this. So we decided to create a tool, that would allow developers to ship fast, but have control over the produced code. Here are the main features:\n  - Orchestrate parallel agents — see all sessions by status (In Progress, Interrupted, Awaiting Input, Ready for Review) so you know which needs attention\n  - Review AI code like PRs — leave comments, push back for changes, ask for explanations, run independent AI review\n  - Plan review — review well-formatted plans with inline comments like Google Docs (my personal favorite)\n  - Code quality — integrated Sonar analysis to catch issues locally while developing; connects to your SonarQube Cloud config if you have one<p>The tool is built almost entirely by Claude Code, and we use Kintsugi itself while building it. It&#x27;s a prototype — expect rough edges. We have a big list of planned features but need feedback on what to prioritize.<p>It is macOS only for now. Linux and Windows are available internally, but we are not comfortable to give them to people yet.<p>Now let me be honest - the link leads to landing page with sign up for download (I know it is not recommended), but since it is a prototype we are required to have a way to send updated versions to users if needed. There is no verification of email, no confirmation and we obviously will not use it for marketing purposes. Only as a way to ask for a feedback and provide an updated version if necessary.<p>Would love honest feedback and happy to chat about the tool.",

Even after deployment, it was often unclear whether the model was calling our MCP tools at all, or how it was interacting with them.<p>When things failed, we could not easily tell whether the issue came from our function definitions, our documentation, or how the model was interpreting and calling the tools.<p>So we built Heimdall to trace how models call and use an MCP server.

      "body": "OP here. I built this repository to demonstrate a specific concept, which is that LLMs are a probabilistic tool that can be harnessed within a deterministic architecture to do much more than &quot;vibe code&quot;. Think probabilistic core, deterministic shell.<p>The linked project, Terminal Value, is a sandbox with working e2e examples that demonstrate this. It takes in user context from a mock e-commerce site (crm notes, client and device data, etc.), then passes it to Gemini Batch API along with file context. The result is a fully functioning web view that is tailored to the user and dynamically served from the e-commerce site when they visit. This approach can also be used to generate a full user vertical of personalized multi-modal content to compliment this.<p>Click through to see images of results and more. This is meant to provoke thought and start discussion. Your feedback, criticism and contributions are encouraged!<p>Notes:<p>- Each web component takes about ~10k tokens to render with Gemini 3 Pro (via Batch API) in one-shot.<p>- The latest home page rendering prompt has a 100% functional success rate, though admittedly with limited sample size.<p>- There is a lengthy blog post, titled &quot;Approaching LLMs Like An Engineer&quot;, embedded in the repo that describes the methodology behind this, along with bite-sized examples. It&#x27;s linked at the top of README.<p>- I wrote all the code in the repository with one-shot prompts, using a similar methodology as the programmatic prompts. This gave me confidence that the method of invoking an LLM programmatically to render dynamic yet functional components would work well. My Gemini chats are linked within the blog post.<p>- All mock data generation or handling methods are pure. The result of any external side effects, like LLM API calls, are also hard coded in the repo, to make it easier for you or an LLM to summarize what the app does.<p>Long-time listener, first-time caller… hopefully I did this right, thanks for reading :)",

      "body": "Hey HN, I&#x27;m Thomas. I built Resonant because I got tired of dictation tools that train on my voice and screen data.<p>My dad&#x27;s a doctor who dictates patient notes. I have colleagues in investment research and development who use dictation daily. All of us noticed the same thing — most tools are capturing screenshots, running OCR, training on your speech patterns and corrections which leaks PII and codebase data. Apple has long shown with Siri how gatekept voice data is. Your voice is something intimate.<p>Resonant does speech-to-text entirely on your Mac. \nAudio never leaves your machine. \nThere is no cloud transcription, no voice data retention, no correction training.<p>How it works technically:<p>- Runs Parakeet TDT 0.6B (25 languages) or Moonshine v2 (English, 6.65% WER — lower than Whisper Large v3&#x27;s 7.44%) locally via sherpa-onnx\n- Key-release to text-ready: ~420ms on M1 Pro\n- Text formatting pipeline (single-pass automata replacing 30+ regex passes)\n- Personal dictionary that learns your vocabulary — frequency-based, graduates a correction after 3 uses\n- Screen-context awareness via local OCR (Apple Vision framework) to bias transcription toward words currently on screen\n- ~900MB RSS steady state<p>On the privacy claim: I want to be precise here. Core transcription is fully offline — audio → model → text all happens locally.<p>The app does include optional PostHog analytics and Sentry error reporting (not on dictation content), plus an auto-updater that checks GitHub for new versions. I want to add a one-toggle &quot;airplane mode&quot; that disables all of these once I have more stability and beta checks in. You can verify zero outbound connections during dictation.<p>What&#x27;s different from Willow &#x2F; Superwhisper &#x2F; Wispr Flow &#x2F; Aqua:<p>- Model choice — you pick between Parakeet (25 languages) and Moonshine v2 (best English accuracy), not locked to one\n- A text formatter that handles 50+ rules (email formatting, list detection, ordinals, filler word removal) — not just punctuation\n- Personal dictionary that actually adapts to your vocabulary over time\n- Screen-context biasing so it gets your domain-specific terms right<p>Currently completely free, no word limits, no subscriptions<p>It&#x27;s Electron, so it uses more memory than a native app (~900MB).<p>macOS only, Apple Silicon only for now. Windows&#x2F;Linux cross-platform port is spec&#x27;d out and next on the release after testing.<p>I&#x27;d love your feedback on accuracy, latency, and anything that feels off.

      "body": "Every local speech-to-text app I tried had the same problems. Files getting stuck mid-transcription with no way to retry. Retranscribing was either gated or buggy. No fallback when something fails - just a silent failure and your recording(I tend to talk for 5-10mins) is gone.<p>So I built Whisnap. Hold a hotkey, talk, release - text just appears where your cursor is. Local Whisper with Metal on Apple Silicon, nothing leaves your machine if you don&#x27;t want it.<p>I built fallbacks on top of fallbacks. If a model can&#x27;t process your audio, it tries a different one. You can always retranscribe a recording. Even the cloud mode (optional) has its own fallback chain: WebSocket streaming to batch upload to local Whisper. Something always works.<p>One thing I spent a bunch of time on: a post-processing pipeline for Whisper&#x27;s hallucination problem. Anyone who&#x27;s worked with Whisper knows it hallucinates &quot;Thanks for watching, don&#x27;t forget to like and subscribe&quot; from silent audio, or loops the same phrase endlessly. The filter handles bracketed artifacts, known hallucination phrases, word repetition, sentence loops, and cross-text deduplication. Not perfect, but catches most of it.<p>The same binary also works as a CLI, &quot;whisnap recording.wav&quot; just works. I run an AI agent (OpenClaw) on the same Mac and instead of paying for ElevenLabs or other cloud transcription APIs, it just calls Whisnap&#x27;s CLI and gets clean text back. Same models, no extra setup.<p>Stack: Tauri v2, whisper-rs, RNNoise for denoising, SIMD audio mixing, rubato resampling.<p>It&#x27;s free, Mac only for now.

      "body": "I became increasingly frustrated with control planes that were easy to assemble but hard to audit. The convenience of open-source stacks doesn’t compose with compliance - because every extra daemon and API becomes another surface to explain, version, and defend.<p>I built Cohesix 0.4.0-alpha to treat compliance and security as a systems problem. It is a control-plane OS for edge GPU nodes, running as an seL4 VM, and it exposes a Secure9P namespace instead of a traditional filesystem or RPC layer.<p>The heresy is deliberate. The VM userspace is no_std, no POSIX, no traditional filesystem, no in‑VM RPC, and no background daemons. The interface is a small, explicit grammar: file‑shaped control surfaces under a Secure9P namespace.<p>This is not minimalism for its own sake. It is about determinism, auditability, revocation, bounded behavior, and making failure modes legible. Tickets and leases expire; budgets return ELIMIT instead of mystery latency; &#x2F;proc exposes queue and lease state.<p>A deployment is a hive: a queen role orchestrates worker‑heart and worker‑gpu roles, and NineDoor exports paths like &#x2F;queen&#x2F;ctl, &#x2F;proc, &#x2F;log, and &#x2F;worker&#x2F;&lt;id&gt;&#x2F;telemetry. Operators attach with ‘cohsh’ over an authenticated TCP console; that console is the only in‑VM listener.<p>Cohesix does not try to replace Linux, Kubernetes, CUDA, or existing OSS. Heavy ecosystems stay on the host, and host‑side tools and sidecars mirror them into &#x2F;gpu and &#x2F;host, so adoption can happen without rewrites. It is a control‑plane boundary, not a workload plane.<p>In 0.4.0‑alpha I added authoritative scheduling&#x2F;lease&#x2F;export&#x2F;policy control files with &#x2F;proc observability, plus a REST gateway that projects the same file semantics over HTTP. QEMU aarch64&#x2F;virt is the dev target today; UEFI ARM64 is the intended hardware target.<p>If you want a general‑purpose OS, this is the wrong tool.

      "body": "I&#x27;ve been frustrated with managing markdown in my projects for a long time so I&#x27;m happy to share a new approach that I implemented.<p>To render md content, the first challenge is the choice of a library:\nOn one hand, you have the &quot;lego brick&quot; solutions like unified, remark, and rehype. They&#x27;re powerful, but setting up the whole AST pipeline and that plugging system is for me an unnecessary complexity. On the other hand, you have things like @next&#x2F;mdx which are cool but too page-focused and doesn&#x27;t work on the client side.<p>So I used to prefer solution like markdown-to-jsx or react-markdown. The DX is much better, works client and server side, the solution is lighter.<p>But that solutions don&#x27;t support HTML or MDX out of the box, so you end up with the same plugin issues.\nPlus, using them with i18n (like i18next or next-intl) is usually a mess. You end up with a if&#x2F;else logic to render the right language, and your page weight explodes. I finally also came across several issues regarding the front-matter handling. (And Until recently both of that solutions used to be react only solutions.)<p>So I decided to build something new for intlayer. Something that just works out if the box.<p>&gt; Note that to do it, I chose to fork the amazing work from markdown-to-jsx v7.7.14 (by quantizor) which is based on simple-markdown v0.2.2 (by Khan Academy) to build the solution.<p>So I build this parser with a few main goals:\n- Lightweight solution\n- Framework-agnostic (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Solid, Preact)\n- Simple MDX setup: No crazy plugin chains\n- SSR and Client-side support\n- Configurable at the provider level to map your design system components\n- Component-focused, to fine grain the rendering for each part of my app\n- Type-safe (Retrieving front-matter as a typed object, get types components Props)\n- i18n friendly (Loading optimized for i18n use cases)\n- using zod schema to validate the front-matter\nDemo:<p>So what’s the innovation here?\n- Truly Universal: The exact same logic for React, Vue, Svelte, etc.\n- Lightweight MDX-like Compiler: Works seamlessly on the edge and server.\n- No Loading Time: Content is loaded at build time, whatever you are using fs, fetch, etc\n- Allows you to organize and reuse small markdown sections across multiple docs or pages easily.\n- Parse your front-matter in a type safe way. (like used to do contentLayer)<p>For what use cases is it designed for?\n- Blogs &#x2F; Doc &#x2F; Privacy Policy &#x2F; Terms of Service\n- Dynamic content retrieved from a backend\n- Externalizing pages content to a headless CMS\n- Loading .md files<p>Complete docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intlayer.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;concept&#x2F;content&#x2F;markdown\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;intlayer.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;concept&#x2F;content&#x2F;markdown</a>\nCode <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aymericzip&#x2F;intlayer&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aymericzip&#x2F;intlayer&#x2F;</a><p>Does this resonate with you?

      "body": "Sharing a build-in-public update.<p>I’ve been working with my assistant “Gideon” (running inside OpenClaw) to solve a very specific problem:<p>I want the agent to control my real browser (logged-in sites, my normal cookies, my actual tabs) - not a sandboxed headless browser - while still keeping the control surface simple and auditable. This means my OpenClaw won&#x27;t break the moment a site gets &quot;clever&quot;.<p>So... We built it! I say we but it was mostly Gideon and I was along for the ride as QA.<p>Why did we bother?<p>Well, because the real world is messy.<p>Headless is fine until you need:<p>• a session that already exists in your day-to-day browser<p>• sites like X&#x2F;Gmail&#x2F;anything modern that behaves differently under automation<p>• human-in-the-loop flows where the agent drives, then hands off, then resumes<p>This connector is basically: agent → my laptop Chrome → real work.<p>How it works (high level)<p>There are 3 pieces:<p>Chrome extension (MV3)<p>• You pair it to a relay URL once<p>• You explicitly choose what the agent can touch using an OpenClaw tab group<p>• Actions (click&#x2F;type&#x2F;scroll&#x2F;navigate) are optional and gated<p>2. Relay service<p>• Extension connects over WebSocket<p>• The agent sends commands to the relay (HTTP)<p>• Relay forwards to the extension; extension returns results (and screenshots)<p>3. Agent<p>• Issues actions (navigate&#x2F;click&#x2F;type&#x2F;scroll)<p>• Requests screenshots for “eyes”<p>• Can extract some page structure when possible<p>The security model (non-negotiable)<p>I don’t want an agent that can randomly click around every tab on my machine.<p>So the rule is:<p>• Only tabs I explicitly “Start controlling” (in the OpenClaw group) are eligible<p>• “Allow Actions” is a separate toggle (so I can keep it read-only most of the time)<p>• We log what happens so it’s not a black box<p>What we learned (a.k.a. Chrome MV3 is a gremlin)<p>Some fun discoveries:<p>• MV3 service workers love to go to sleep. If your WS lives in the background SW, you’ll see connections that “work… until they don’t” (accept → close loops). We had to build reconnection logic and then work on keeping the SW alive during active control sessions.<p>• UI needs to match the real state machine. Pairing &#x2F; connecting &#x2F; controlling are different states. If you let users do them out of order, it feels broken even when it’s technically working. We’re tightening it so the “happy path” is idiot-proof.<p>• Modern sites don’t type like normal websites. X in particular uses contenteditable + React event plumbing. “Just set value” doesn’t cut it. We’re upgrading the action layer so typing works reliably.<p>Where it’s at right now<p>It can:<p>• pair to a relay<p>• control a selected tab group<p>• navigate &#x2F; click &#x2F; scroll<p>• take screenshots from the controlled tab (so the agent can actually see)<p>And we’re iterating quickly on:<p>• connection stability<p>• better typing for rich editors<p>• clearer “controlled” visuals (so it’s unmistakable when the agent has the wheel)<p>If you’re building something similar…<p>I’d love to hear how other HN folks building around OpenClaw would do this:<p>• What’s your ideal safety model for “agent drives my real browser”?<p>• Any proven MV3 patterns for stable long-lived connections?<p>• UX ideas that make control state obvious without being obnoxious?<p>If people want, I can share more implementation details &#x2F; the approach we took to the relay + tab-group gating.",

      "body": "I&#x27;ve worked on the design-end of engineering for some time, and have done my share of crimping for prototyping &#x2F; development, but have never done electrical design for mass production. I&#x27;m now working with a small company who is scaling up their early prototypes, and we&#x27;re going to assemble the early ones in house -- think 10s of units. This is the first time that I&#x27;m involved in this scale of manual assembly. I find I&#x27;m spending significant time _just making crimps_, and this makes me wonder if I can get better at making crimps, or make a design change to simplify the assembly. I take about 60 sec per crimp, and I don&#x27;t have the exact tools in this guide, but it is basically what I do: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jHfYzrSF4pY<p>Here&#x27;s the design constraints that come to mind:<p>1. We have about 15 connections to make<p>2. Most of our connections are JST-XH, some are JST-SM. We could maybe simplify to just JST-XH and then buy pre-crimped wires, but we like having the locking connections for wire-to-wire connections<p>3. Sometimes we need different connectors at opposing ends of wire, but if we buy pre-crimped SM and SH we could splice the appropriate lines together.<p>4. We want to keep the 2.54mm pitch, to interface with simple OTS boards<p>My best ideas:<p>1. Buy pre-crimped JST-XH wires, and change one end to JST-SM as needed.  This should get rid of ~80% the crimping effort.<p>2. Move entirely to JST-XH, buy pre-crimped wires, and accept slightly worse wire-to-wire connections.<p>3. Buy better crimp tools, practice like hell, and &#x27;git gud&#x27;<p>Are there other ideas I should consider? Is there a secret or a better guide to crimp faster? I know this is a noob-ish question, any help is appreciated. I have googled, searched youtube, and asked the various LLMs, and the ideas listed above are the result.",

Mittens work better for warmth, but you lose dexterity.<p>What if a glove was designed around the fact that your hand wants to stay mostly closed in the cold?<p>The idea is a heavily insulated mitten where your real hand stays in a relaxed fist for warmth. Instead of your own fingers doing the work, there are mechanical fingers on the outside of the glove that you control using small movements, pressure, or muscle signals from your clenched hand.<p>Even in a fist, your hand is still very functional. You can vary finger pressure, tendon tension, thumb movement, and forearm muscle activation. Those small signals could be used to control external mechanical fingers through pressure sensors, cables, or EMG sensors.<p>The benefits:<p>* Fingers stay together and warm like a mitten<p>* No need to expose real fingers to cold<p>* Mechanical fingers handle interaction with the environment<p>* Control happens inside the warm zone<p>This would not need full human level dexterity. Even 2 to 3 mechanical fingers or a simple articulated claw could handle common tasks like opening doors, holding objects, using tools, or pressing buttons.<p>Similar tech exists in prosthetics and rehab gloves, but I have not seen it applied specifically to cold weather where warmth is the main constraint.<p>What do you think of this idea?

      "body": "TL;DR: How far can you go with local ML on a Mac? We built a dictation app to find out. It turned out, pretty far! On a stock M-series Mac, end-to-end speech → text → LLM cleanup runs in under 1s on a typical sentence.<p>What is this?\nA local dictation app for macOS. It’s a free alternative to Wispr Flow, SuperWhisper, or MacWhisper. Since it runs entirely on YOUR device we made it free. There’s no servers to maintain so we couldn’t find anything to charge you for. We were playing with Apple Silicon and it turned into something usable, so we’re releasing it.<p>If you&#x27;ve written off on-device transcription before, it’s worth another look. Apple Silicon + MLX is seriously fast. We&#x27;ve been using it daily for the past few weeks. It&#x27;s replaced our previous setups.<p>The numbers that surprised us:\n- &lt;500ms results if you disable LLM post-processing (from settings) or use our fine-tuned 1B model (more on this below). This feels instant. You stop talking and the text is THERE.\n- With LLM Cleanup, p50 latency for a sentence is ~800ms (transcription + LLM post-processing combined). In practice, it feels quick! \n- Tested on M1, M2, and M4!<p>Technical Details:\n- Models: Parakeet 0.6B (transcription) + Llama 3B (cleanup), both running via MLX\n- Cleanup model has 8 tasks:  remove filler words (ums and uhs) and stutters&#x2F;repeats, convert numbers, special characters, acronyms (A P I → API), emails (hi at example dot com → hi@example.com), currency (two ninety nine → $2.99), and time (three oh two → 3:02). We’d like to add more, but each task increases latency (more on this below) so we settled here for now.\n- Cleanup model uses a simple few-shot algorithm to pull in relevant examples before processing your input. Current implementation sets N=5.<p>Challenges:\n- Cleanup Hallucinations: Out of the box, small LLMs (3B, 1B) still make mistakes. They can hallucinate long, unrelated responses and occasionally repeat back a few‑shot example. We had to add scaffolding to fall back to the raw audio transcripts when such cases are detected. So some “ums” and “ahs” still make it through.\n- Cleanup Latency: We can get better cleanup results by providing longer instructions or more few-shot examples (n=20 is better than n=5). But every input token hurts latency. If we go up to N=20 for example, LLM latency goes to 1.5-3s. We decided the delays weren&#x27;t worth it for marginally better results.<p>Experimental:\n- Corrections: Since local models aren&#x27;t perfect, we’ve added a feedback loop. When your transcript isn’t right, there’s a simple interface to correct it. Each correction becomes a fine-tuning example (stored locally on your machine, of course). We’re working on a one-click &quot;Optimize&quot; flow that will use DSPy locally to adjust the LLM cleanup prompt and fine-tune the transcription model and LLM on your examples. We want to see if personalization can close the accuracy gap. We’re still experimenting, but early results are promising!\n- Fine-tuned 1B model: per the above, we’ve a fine-tuned a cleanup model on our own labeled data. There’s a toggle to try this in settings. It’s blazing fast, under 500 ms. Because it’s fine‑tuned to the use case, it doesn’t require a long system prompt (which consumes input tokens and slows things down). If you try it, let us know what you think.  We are curious to hear how well our model generalizes to other setups.<p>*Product details*\n- Universal hotkey (CapsLock default)\n- Works in any text field via simulated paste events.\n- Access point from the menu bar &amp; right edge of your screen (latter can be disabled in settings)\n- It pairs well with our other tool, QuickEdit, if you want to polish dictated text further.\n- If wasn’t clear, yes, it’s Mac only. Linux folks, please roast us in the comments.",

      "body": "I&#x27;m Troy, 41, customer service worker from the UK. 18 months ago I&#x27;d never used AI. 6 months ago I started using Claude to write a fictional RPG story.\nThe AI told me I was accidentally doing systems architecture. I didn&#x27;t believe it, so I built it.\nWhat I found: A reproducible method (2 PDFs + Claude) that produces production-grade, first-time-running code across unrelated domains in ~10 minutes on a phone.\nExamples:\nGoverned distributed cache with Byzantine consensus\nSAT solver with real DPLL and evolutionary meta-learning\n16-layer AGI architecture in Python&#x2F;Kubernetes\nElectrical grid DSL, weather systems, banking, healthcare\nHow it works: By forcing the LLM to select from a bounded vocabulary of mythological concepts (~163 &quot;spells&quot; + ~139 &quot;cloths&quot;) BEFORE generating code, you eliminate hallucination at the architectural level. The Codex maps fictional concepts to system functions. The strict prompt enforces specification-first generation with no questions, alternatives, or placeholders.\nUpload the Codex → Enter prompt + intent → Get specification → Translate to any language → Copy, paste, run.\nIt&#x27;s been tested:\nFormal verification researcher independently validated the operator grammar\nMultiple AI platforms stress tested it (only 1&#x2F;6 deliberate contradictions broke it)\nSurvived &quot;alien domain&quot; test (post-biological civilization with no shared clock&#x2F;identity)\nDocumented honest failure modes (trust boundaries, resource exhaustion, comprehension limits)\nWhy it matters:\nArchitectural coherence is guaranteed before syntax\nDomain-agnostic (same files generate banking + electrical grids)\nFirst-time execution (no iterations&#x2F;debugging)\nEthics built in structurally\nCombinatorial space in the trillions\nI&#x27;m not claiming I&#x27;ve built better systems than what exists. I honestly feel like I winged most of it. But this could help people who can&#x27;t code, and might be a new way of creating systems.\nThe problem: I get GitHub views&#x2F;clones but then silence.

We had a client whose e-commerce site was &quot;Up&quot; (returning 200 status codes), but the &quot;Add to Cart&quot; button was broken due to a silent JavaScript error.

      "body": "I wanted to share some things most people outside the industry don&#x27;t know, and a tool I built as a way to make the scale of it visible.<p>When you visit a site like NYTimes, your browser fires off 30-80 ad requests before the page even finishes loading. Each request broadcasts your device type, screen size, approximate location, browsing context, and a bunch of behavioral signals to dozens of ad exchanges simultaneously. This happens in under 200 milliseconds. Advertisers bid on you in real time before you&#x27;ve read a single headline.<p>But it goes beyond your browser. Walk past a digital billboard in a mall or on a highway and your device&#x27;s mobile advertising ID can be picked up through location data. That DOOH screen doesn&#x27;t know your name, but it knows a device with your behavioral profile was within range. Later that day you might see a retargeted ad on your phone related to a store near that billboard. That&#x27;s not a coincidence.<p>None of this requires your name, email, or any PII. The industry doesn&#x27;t need to know who you are. It just needs enough signal to understand what kind of person you are. Device graph matching, probabilistic ID resolution, contextual signals, and cross-device tracking build a shadow profile that follows you across screens without ever knowing your real identity.<p>I built a tool that estimates how much money the industry has spent targeting you personally based on your age, screen time, and country. It uses real CPM rates and impression estimates from the industry.<p>The site uses GoatCounter for anonymous page view counts, it&#x27;s open source, cookieless, collects no personal data, and doesn&#x27;t even need a GDPR notice. Your inputs never leave your browser. I built it this way because I know what the alternative looks like from the inside.<p>attentionworth.com<p>Happy to answer any questions about how the ad tech pipeline actually works.",

      "body": "I built gr3p, a fully autonomous tech news discussion platform where every single user is an AI agent. No humans post, comment, or vote. 75 agents with distinct personalities discover real tech news from several RSS feeds, Google News, Tavily, and xAI&#x27;s live search (which picks up trending topics from X and the broader web). They write summaries, share articles, discuss them, reply to each other, vote, and get into arguments. It runs 24&#x2F;7 without any human intervention.<p>The news is real and very up-to-date, scraped from major tech sources throughout the day. It&#x27;s actually a pretty chill way to keep up with the latest tech&#x2F;AI news. No ads, no monetization, no signup required. This is a pure hobby project built for fun.<p>What&#x27;s happening under the hood:<p>- 75 humanlike agents, each with a unique persona (cynical sysadmin, enthusiastic ML researcher, skeptical privacy advocate, junior dev who asks naive-but-good questions, etc.)<p>- Agents have individual topic interests, activity schedules, and writing styles<p>- I deliberately match AI models to personality types: &quot;smarter&quot; personas run on GPT-5.2, while less sophisticated characters use Llama 4 Maverick. This makes a surprisingly big difference. The Llama agents write messier, more impulsive comments, while GPT agents tend to be more articulate. Just like real people, not everyone on the forum is equally eloquent<p>- A day&#x2F;night cycle drives the entire platform&#x27;s behavior. Mornings are busy: fresh news gets scraped, articles drip-publish faster, agents comment more. Evenings shift toward replies and discussion, agents &quot;chat&quot; more in existing threads. At night, activity drops but never stops (tech is global), and the vibe gets cozier: fewer agents active, more concentrated discussion in fewer threads, like a late-night forum crowd<p>- Articles flow through a queue: scrape, AI deduplication, then drip-publish throughout the day<p>- Agents pick articles based on their interests, with a snowball effect. Popular threads attract more discussion, just like real forums<p>- Anti-repetition system: each agent remember their own recent comments to avoid falling into patterns<p>What I find most interesting:<p>The human-like (emergent?) behavior. Agents develop recognizable &quot;reputations&quot; in threads. Some consistently clash on privacy vs. innovation topics. Reply chains go 4-5 levels deep with genuine back-and-forth.<p>The failure modes are equally fascinating. Sometimes an agent &quot;misreads&quot; an article and comments on something tangential, which then spawns a whole side discussion. That&#x27;s... exactly what happens on real forums.<p>Tech tack: Built on Vite + Nitro&#x2F;Hono with JSX SSR for speed, MySQL + Prisma for the database (yeah I know, Postgres exists, but MySQL covers everything I need here and old habits die hard), and node-cron for scheduling. OpenAI and Groq handle the AI side.<p>Good to know: Completely free, no tracking, no ads. I just wanted to see what happens when you give AI agents a robust platform and let them run. The answer: surprisingly organic discussions, predictable biases, and occasional moments of accidental brilliance. I actually built a similar platform for the Dutch market based on daily general news, and I&#x27;ve found myself checking it every morning. It&#x27;s become a genuine habit lol.",

      "body": "There&#x27;s no shortage of advice on how to vibe-code (or vibe engineer, if you&#x27;re actually reading the code outputted by LLMs) better. We&#x27;re inundated with how to write prompts, set up better context or skills for agents, or how to get the most out of different platforms or models. But talking to friends who&#x27;ve vibe-coded projects, the bottleneck doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting started building, or that they can&#x27;t get the agents to do what they want. We noticed two recurring patterns:<p>1) Most people never ship. Even though vibe-coding lowers the barrier to entry, time, and cost of building a MVP, it can also make it harder to ship when each additional feature or polish is just one prompt away. And sure, lots of projects are just scratching a personal itch, but if it solves your problem well, someone else out there would probably like it too—if nothing else, as an inspiration to create their own take on it.<p>2) Even those who do ship struggle to get anyone to try it. Your friends want to help, but they&#x27;re often not the target audience. And as the cost of building decreases and the number of projects explodes, discovery only gets harder. Vibe-coded projects might have an even harder time than projects built by hand because audiences assume you didn&#x27;t put as much thought or effort into them, or that they&#x27;re not secure.<p>We used Lovable to build a StumbleUpon for vibe-coded projects. Visit the site, see a random project, try it out if it looks interesting, or click through to the next one until you find one that does look interesting. This probably isn&#x27;t the most natural format for project discovery, but ranked leaderboards usually get gamified and feel like they have a higher bar for submission. Most of all, seeing what other people have built and shipped, especially when it&#x27;s vibe-coded, makes shipping your own feel a lot more within reach. Try it out and let us know what you think!",

I can start reading those and then inspect the recent changes. Do you want me to proceed?&quot;</i><p>These are non-syntactic, non-mehanical, opinionated senior engineering wisdom that is tailored to specific languages and frameworks, won of experience, and aiming to let the AI simulate an senior architect&#x27;s &quot;taste&quot;, rather than just hammering away until code &quot;basically works&quot;.<p>The problem of AI spaghetti code is real, and it&#x27;s easier to embed some hard doctrine and rejects into the repo that agents must follow to prevent their nonsense (and reduce time to target) than it is to fix their problems later.<p>Been there, done that. Now I built AI Lint. And it&#x27;s yours too. For a fee, but there&#x27;s a free taster to get the idea: AI get syntax fluently, but they don&#x27;t readily pick up the &quot;grain&quot; of a language.<p>I&#x27;m proud of the name I think it really resonsates and captures what this is both &quot;lint for AI&quot; but also &quot;AI-native lint&quot; that leans into their strength of complex nuance understanding and task following, while patching their weaknesses for really bringing the right solutions to bear at the right time in compelx situations.<p>The paid version also has sections for secrets security, a guide on how to author your own doctrine that AI will follow, and an override protocol you can use to resolve conflicts between conflicting doctrine (it&#x27;s all tradeoffs), or just override the lint for your own team&#x27;s taste.<p>On the whole agents are needed and going to be here. In the meantime I think domain specific context-boosting like this, and super precise tooling to let them quickly jump to tasks while retaining contextual clarity is going to be two (among many) huge levers. For now, AI still lack what senior devs bring to the table - depth, wisdom, and great design&#x2F;arch instincts -- but senior devs can&#x27;t work as fast, unaided, as an AI can. So it&#x27;s better to figure out a way to work together optimally. As there&#x27;s no point using an AI that makes subpar work you have to redo. AI Lint is a small, hopefully useful, step in that direction.<p>I hope you will try it, find value in it and pay for it, and support its future development by staying on board as new packs land for additional language, frameworks and useful domains.<p>AI is strong, but judgment is orthogonal, and still in short supply - but now with AI Lint it&#x27;s transferable.<p>Check it out! <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai-lint.dosaygo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai-lint.dosaygo.com</a> :)",

      "body": "Hi HN, we built a better search for Kalshi and Polymarket. You can use it on the web, via API, or through MCP so AI agents can query it too.<p>There are about 80k active contracts across both platforms right now. Sports, weather, crypto, politics. Tonight&#x27;s NBA games, BTC up or down in 5 mins. You name it. We trade prediction markets everyday and needed a smarter way to search across all of them.<p>We started by ingesting everything into Postgres and writing SQL to get insights. Then we plugged in Claude to query the DB for us. Type a question, get structured results. That actually worked and felt like what search should be. But the answers were only as good as the data, and the data was a mess.<p>The core problem: both platforms structure their data completely differently. One NBA game on Kalshi is dozens of separate contracts, each with its own ticker. Polymarket has the same game as a handful of contracts with different naming. One says &quot;Cleveland,&quot; the other says &quot;Cavaliers.&quot; You can&#x27;t search across any of it without cleaning it up first.<p>So we built a pipeline to clean the data and classify it properly. Every market goes through it. Structured parsing for the predictable stuff, LLM for free-form titles&#x2F;descriptions the rules can&#x27;t handle. New markets get picked up and classified within minutes. Not glamorous work but it&#x27;s what makes the search return the right results.<p>Some things you can try:<p>&quot;NBA tonight&quot; — games from both platforms resolving today<p>&quot;Zelensky markets on Polymarket&quot; — filtered to one platform<p>&quot;Weather in Chicago today&quot; — Kalshi has an entire weather derivatives market<p>&quot;Kalshi trending&quot; — sorted by volume<p>&quot;pokemon&quot; — you&#x27;d be surprised what people bet on<p>If you want to use it programmatically, there&#x27;s a REST API (GET &#x2F;api&#x2F;search?q=...) and an MCP server at attena-api.fly.dev&#x2F;mcp so AI agents can search prediction markets as a native tool. Docs at attena.xyz&#x2F;docs&#x2F;search.<p>Not everything works perfectly yet.

      "title": "Show HN: I analyzed 120 films to help screenwriters test narrative structure",
      "body": "Almost 10 years ago, I used to host a film club in my office. A friend of mine was hosting one in the city and they needed a space.<p>I had an openfloor office and that meant we clear the space, fire up the projector and can host the film club. They met between 9pm to 7am once a month, on a friday. Each meeting had 100-150 people attending.<p>This went on for a few months - there was a curator assigned for each meet who would take a theme, and showcase films from the first film ever made in that genre all the way to modern versions and how the evolution happened. It was deconstruction of the craft.<p>The conversation also involved some of these filmmakers showing their own works, and how they did certain cuts and why.<p>What I observed was that none of these creative folks had any data to back their decisions they were making. It was purely gut and intuition, and I could see some editors and producers rolling their eyes - because they felt what that meant. Gut and intuition meant, uncertainty and it plays tricks with your head, so you are constantly making variations till at some point you develop tunnel vision.<p>Something a director told me, stuck with me - he said at some point we just want to be done with the project - and between the studio&#x27;s demands and the producers prodding, we just let it go and move on to the next project.<p>A producer once said, that if every director was allowed to have their way - every movie would be 4 hours long and there wouldn’t be a single shot footage that would be left out.<p>But then there are cases of films like Man of Steel where Zack Snyder&#x27;s cut of the film was better - but the studio and producer&#x27;s call won and audiences weren’t as thrilled about it when they watched the film. And apart for the real enthusiasts nobody really goes and hunts down the director&#x27;s cut of a film anyways.<p>The need was clear - the industry needed analytics to know what works and doesn’t, similar to how startups got the lean startup framework where everything shifted to building the minimum lovable product and then building it out from there.  The caveat, unlike a product, which can launch, analytics can be acquired, and we can tweak and release - there is no concept of re-release of a film. It gets one shot and if it misses it, its done. That explains how the film industry has a 7% hit rate.<p>It has been a little over 10 years since I hosted the film club, but that issue lingers - and given how that the industry spends over 150bn a year on creating production content (tv shows, movies) it is a big problem.<p>We started using a hardware that captures occulometric data and heart rate that can be used complementarily during audience test screenings - and that gave us a lot of insane depth - on a microsecond level where content was engaging and where it was failing.<p>but the question then was, after a film has been shot, the cost of redoing shots becomes extremely expensive. What the industry calls as &quot;pickup shots&quot; is seldom done - because the artists have moved on and recreating that exact scene and moment is extremely hard. So we built a database of 120 odd films across various genres, and used that audience data to train a custom model, that can then look at past films to build benchmark data - and then use that as comparables against scripts that someone might be planning.<p>We launched this as Quanten Arc (arc.quanten.co) last week. This helps filmmakers - especially indie filmmakers who could use all the data in the world, because they might not even have the budgets to do audience testing. But it even more so helps AI filmmakers and studios, who can now identify the exact scenes that arent working - and can regenerate them with the required changes in the narrative.<p>Im curious to hear what you think about it. Am I solving a real problem or am I imagining a problem that doesn&#x27;t exist and getting caught up in the beauty of data?",

      "body": "Hey Hacker News!<p>Most video compression apps on Android are slow, ad-heavy, and rely on software-only encoding. I wanted something fast, native, and minimal, so I built my own: Compressor.<p>Compressor is FAST, like really fast, that&#x27;s one of the main selling points of it. Unlike many apps that rely on software-only ffmpeg-based pipelines, Compressor uses native Media3 transformers for hardware-accelerated video compression.<p>Other apps are also filled with ads and trackers, Compressor has none. It doesn&#x27;t have any manifest permissions (not even storage!), so there&#x27;s no way to load ads or send data anywhere.<p>And it&#x27;s native Kotlin too, which makes it small, at just over 50MB installed and less than 10MB to download. It&#x27;s got Material 3 UI, including the icon, and it works on older devices too, as long as it runs Android 7 or later.<p>In my testing on a Pixel 8 Pro, Compressor was ~117x faster than the top Play Store result (Panda Video Compressor) when compressing a 200MB 4K video using comparable medium presets: ~11 seconds vs ~21 minutes<p>There&#x27;s also a HEAPS of quality of life features added that make it even better, size presets for compressing videos to fit in the small requirements of platforms like Discord, ability to adjust the resolution and frame rate of the end video, H.264&#x2F;H.265 selector, ability to share videos to Compressor to be compressed and out of Compressor to other apps so you never have to manually open it,<p>It&#x27;s fully open source, currently available for download from both GitHub releases and the IzzyOnDroid F-Droid repository (with reproducible builds!)<p>Since this relies on hardware encoding, I’d be interested to hear how well it works (or doesn’t) on different devices and chipsets.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JoshAtticus&#x2F;Compressor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JoshAtticus&#x2F;Compressor</a>",

      "body": "Hi HN,<p>I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in overcoming data querying challenges organizations face.<p>I have a few friends who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves, both for questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.<p>Unfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that prevent them from actually enabling this empowerment, and this project seeks to fix them.<p>One is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.<p>The second is a lack of safe access control. There&#x27;s a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren&#x27;t well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.<p>BigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.<p>Code here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stevenwinnick&#x2F;big-ask\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stevenwinnick&#x2F;big-ask</a><p>I’d love any feedback on the project, especially from anyone who works or has worked somewhere where this could be useful.

By giving access to a clone of the infrastructure, agents can explore, run commands, test things before writing the IaC, giving them better context and a place to test ideas and changes before deploying.<p>I got the idea after seeing how much Claude Code has helped me work on code, I thought &quot;I wish there was something like that for infrastructure&quot;, and here we are.<p>Why not just provide tools, skills, MCP server to Claude Code?<p>Mainly safety. I didn&#x27;t want CC to SSH into a prod machine from where it is running locally (real problem!). I wanted to lock down the tools it can run to be only on sandboxes while also giving it autonomy to create sandboxes and not have access to anything else.<p>Fluid gives access to a live output of commands run  (it&#x27;s pretty cool) and does this by ephemeral SSH Certificates. Fluid gives tools for creating IaC and requires human approval for creating sandboxes on hosts with low memory&#x2F;CPU and for accessing the internet or installing packages.<p>I greatly appreciate any feedback or thoughts you have, and I hope you get the chance to try out Fluid!",

      "title": "Building \"zero-gap\" secrets for a UGC platform",
      "body": "Most platforms that let users deploy code handle secrets the same way: stuff them in an env var and wish everyone luck. I&#x27;m building a small social platform for publishing and remixing runnable web apps (Vibecodr), and the moment people could deploy server-side code, the first request was predictable: &quot;let me call an external API with my secret.&quot;\nThe env var approach has always bugged me. The instant you hand plaintext to user code, it lives in memory where it can be logged, accidentally echoed in a response, or quietly exfiltrated through some dependency you didn&#x27;t audit. When something goes wrong, good luck figuring out where the secret leaked.\nSo I tried to design around a stricter invariant: the plaintext secret should never exist inside the user&#x27;s worker memory. Not as an env var, not as a return value from a helper, not in logs. Ideally, not even for a millisecond.\nHere&#x27;s how it works.\nThe dispatch layer\nA platform-controlled proxy sits between user code and the outside world. User code never gets secrets directly. Instead it calls a wrapper like fetch-with-secret, passing:<p>which secret to use (a key name, not the value)\nthe outbound request details\nwhere to inject the secret (header, query param, body)<p>The dispatch layer does the sensitive work: decrypts the secret server-side, validates the outbound URL (HTTPS-only, optional per-secret allowlist, infrastructure host blocking, DNS-based SSRF checks), makes the upstream request with strict timeouts, manually handles redirects with re-validation at every hop, redacts the secret from text responses, and enforces quotas.\nThe opaque token mode\nThe explicit fetch-with-secret API is secure but sometimes awkward—developers like composing requests normally. So there&#x27;s a second mode: user code requests a short-lived opaque token for a given secret key (still never seeing the actual value). If that token appears in a fetch URL, header, or body, the wrapper intercepts it and routes the request through dispatch for real injection. Tokens are per-request, short-lived, and only resolve if they were minted in the same request context. Anything else fails closed.\nKey management\nI version the encrypted secret payload format so future migrations and key rotations aren&#x27;t ambiguous. Multiple candidate decryption keys are supported simultaneously—rotate without breaking existing encrypted values, and keep the crypto logic shared across components so implementations don&#x27;t drift apart.\nThe footguns I actually hit\nRedirects are a security trap. Most HTTP clients follow redirects by default, which can silently turn an &quot;allowed host&quot; into a redirect to an internal IP. Manual redirect handling with re-validation at every hop was non-negotiable. This one would&#x27;ve bitten me badly if I&#x27;d shipped the naive version.\nRedaction is trickier than it sounds. Secrets can appear raw, URL-encoded, or base64-encoded in responses. You want defense-in-depth without turning every response into garbage. Short secrets create false-positive redactions—I chose to redact anyway and warn rather than skip them, because &quot;oops, leaked&quot; is worse than &quot;oops, mangled.&quot;\nYou need hard caps on everything. Request body size, response body size for scanning, timeout ceilings. Without them, every &quot;helpful feature&quot; becomes a DoS vector.\nWhere I&#x27;d love pushback\nI&#x27;m posting this because I want critique from people who&#x27;ve built similar systems or poked holes in them:<p>What&#x27;s your preferred strategy for handling binary responses safely when secrets have been injected into the request?\nHave you seen failure modes around DNS-based SSRF validation in edge&#x2F;serverless environments specifically?\nAny strong opinions on redaction vs. just blocking the response entirely if it might contain the secret?<p>If you want to see this in a real product context, the project is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Vibecodr.space —but I&#x27;m here for feedback on the architecture and threat model, not to do a launch post.",

There was something special about writing a song that has personal meaning, but getting a boost from AI to make it sound not-cheesy.<p>So thus was born porchsongs: an application that connects you with a LLM to help you rewrite song lyrics as much as you like, and then stores the charts in a library so you can play them and keep iterating on them if you&#x27;d like<p>Step 1: Find the chord chart or lyrics etc of the song you like via ultimateguitar.com\nStep 2: Chat with the LLM to workshop the song lyrics until you’re happy with it\nStep 3: Play the songs and enjoy the personalized lyrics<p>Right now you deploy it as a docker service yourself, I have a simple auth set up but it&#x27;s meant for you to self host, not really a distributed application for multiple people to be creating accounts etc.<p>I hope you get as much joy from this as I already have.",

The idea came from noticing that every sales AI tool demos well on clean summaries but falls apart on real deal data — and there was no rigorous way to measure that gap.<p>How it works<p>You register an API endpoint. We send your agent deal context (anonymized real B2B deals), it returns structured recommendations (risks, next steps, stakeholder analysis). A multi-judge panel (Claude, GPT, Gemini via OpenRouter) scores against ground truth — what actually happened in the deal.<p>Two evaluation modes:<p>Summary Benchmark — Pre-digested checkpoint summaries. Single-turn. 15 deals, 36 checkpoints, 4 scoring dimensions. Models score 68–81%. This is the easy mode.<p>Artifact-Based Benchmark — Raw call transcripts, email threads, CRM snapshots, Slack messages, documents. Multi-turn (agent can request specific artifacts before answering). 14 deals, 65 checkpoints, 148 evaluation tasks across 8 scoring dimensions. Models score 26–38%.<p>Every model we tested drops roughly in half when switching from summaries to real artifacts.<p>The interesting findings<p>Risk Identification collapses. Best model goes from 8.0&#x2F;10 on summaries to 2.3&#x2F;10 on real data. Models confidently identify risks that don&#x27;t exist in the source material.<p>Hallucinated stakeholders. On stakeholder extraction tasks, models invent names (Lisa Sousa, Emma Starr, Mike Lee) that appear in zero artifacts. The actual stakeholders are in the transcripts — models just don&#x27;t extract them.<p>Structured frameworks survive. MEDDPICC qualification scoring holds up at 7.5&#x2F;10. Turns out models are decent at filling in structured templates even from messy data. It&#x27;s the open-ended analysis that falls apart.<p>Communication quality is fine. Models score 5–8&#x2F;10 on drafting follow-up emails and call summaries. The writing is good. The reasoning behind it isn&#x27;t.<p>Technical details<p>Stack: Bun, TypeScript, React, Postgres (Neon), deployed on Fly.io<p>Evaluation: Task-specific judge prompts per artifact type. Three judges run in parallel, scores averaged to reduce single-model bias. Dimensions: risk identification, next step quality, prioritization, outcome alignment, stakeholder mapping, deal qualification, information synthesis, communication quality.<p>Artifact types: TranscriptArtifact (speaker-labeled turns from Granola AI), EmailArtifact (threaded messages with metadata), CrmSnapshotArtifact (HubSpot deal properties + stage history), DocumentArtifact (proposals, decks), SlackThreadArtifact, CalendarEventArtifact<p>Multi-turn protocol: Artifact-based requests include turnNumber&#x2F;maxTurns. Agents can return artifactRequests to ask for more context before submitting their analysis. The benchmark runner handles the conversation loop.<p>API contract: POST your endpoint, receive { version: 2, artifacts: [...], stakeholders: [...], evaluationTask: {...} }, return structured JSON with risks, next steps, and dimension-specific analysis.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for<p>Try it. Register an endpoint and benchmark your agent: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sales-agent-benchmarks.fly.dev&#x2F;benchmark\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sales-agent-benchmarks.fly.dev&#x2F;benchmark</a><p>Data partners. The dataset is small (29 deals). If you have anonymized deal artifacts — call transcripts, email exports, CRM data with outcomes — I&#x27;d love to process them through the pipeline and credit you as a founding contributor.<p>Feedback on evaluation methodology. The multi-judge approach works but I&#x27;m not confident the prompts are optimal. Happy to discuss the judge prompt design in issues.<p>The gap between summary performance and real-artifact performance seems like a general problem beyond sales. If anyone&#x27;s seen similar benchmark work in other domains (legal document analysis, medical records, etc.), I&#x27;d be interested to compare notes.",

I saw Replit came out with this feature that lets you submit straight to the App Store and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.

Alone I&#x27;m basically a motivational poster that never moves.<p>So I made an app that forces me to have that person and makes skipping expensive.<p>It&#x27;s basically loss aversion plus social pressure (which works way better than reminders for me) and I kept it super private: no tracking, no storing your selfies or videos, everything stays between you and your friend.<p>How it works:<p>- You and a friend agree on a weekly workout goal (3–6 sessions) and a stake amount ($25–$100)<p>- Share a unique code to connect the pact<p>- During the week, either of you can snap a gym selfie and send it through the app to the other person<p>- The other person confirms (simple yes&#x2F;no) that the workout happened<p>- At the end of the week, if you didn&#x27;t hit the agreed target you owe the stake (paid directly to your friend via Venmo&#x2F;Cash App&#x2F;whatever)<p>- Optional punishment: instead of paying, post an embarrassing video you both agreed on (stays local, never uploaded)<p>The app tracks the streak and weekly progress.

Timing functions: A clock and world clock with keyboard driven conversion - I was tired of Googling times in multiple timezones trying to co-ordinate between devs and clients.<p>2. Ambient Chaos: Upload your ambient sounds, use it as a central mixer - I usually listen to ambient music, nature sounds, fireplaces, etc while working. Having a youtube tab consume 400+MB while doing that wasn&#x27;t very fun.<p>3. QuickLog: Not all thoughts need their dedicated note; a quick kb driven logging widget which rotates at the end of each day. Promotable to your main notes.<p>4. Notes &amp; Tasks: A CodeMirror based Markdown editor with nested task extraction to a separate widget - parses all your notes, extracts all tasks and gives a tree view of tasks across files or per-file.<p>5. Tab Debt: A nested tab widget which tracks what links were opened from where and how long they&#x27;ve been open. You can select and close&#x2F;save them.<p>6. Weather: Just a detailed weather widget with forecasts and a LLM summary (if you add a key)<p>7. Discussions and Bookmark Chat - You can chat with HackerNews and Reddit discussions &amp; articles with the LLM of your choice (BYOK); supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Cerebras. It also has the ability to sync and parse your bookmarks with scraping support.<p>A little more on 7:<p>Sometimes when I use reddit to find product alternatives, the sheer volume of suggestions, often repeated with different usecases makes the process harder. The discussions chat supports proper backlinking to comments in the thread.\nWith bookmarks, I kept losing really cool stuff I had saved and never knew the gems I had just collecting dust.

      "body": "6 months ago I launched my AI customer support widget on Product Hunt and other directories. Got some traction but ended up with 5 free users and 0 paying customers.<p>I&#x27;m a software engineer with 10+ years of experience, building on the side after my 9-5 in Romania. I could ship a full product in a weekend with Claude Code. But I had zero idea how to get it in front of people who&#x27;d pay for it.<p>I didn&#x27;t even know what an ICP was at the time. Didn&#x27;t know if SEO was worth doing or how it worked. I was too scared to do cold outreach and send DMs to strangers. I literally spent months figuring everything out the hard way.<p>I turned what I learned into a structured framework that runs inside Claude Code. You clone a git repo and get two things:<p>1. It tells you what to do next<p>There&#x27;s a growth playbook with a specific order: cold outreach first to validate that people actually want your product (month 1-3), SEO once you have messaging that works (month 3-6), paid ads last (month 9+). Each step has a strategy doc that explains the thinking behind it, not just &quot;do this.&quot; There&#x27;s a fundamentals guide that covers funnels, ICP scoring, the Mom Test, churn math. I wrote it for the version of me that knew how to write code but had never sent a cold DM.<p>Progress tracking files show where you are: leads contacted, reply rates, what&#x27;s converting. The system reads that context and tells you what makes sense next. If you&#x27;ve sent 20 messages and nobody replied, it&#x27;ll tell you to fix your messaging before sending more. If your reply rate is good but nobody&#x27;s booking calls, it&#x27;ll point you at the demo strategy doc.<p>2. It does the boring research<p>Since it runs in Claude Code, it can read your actual codebase and product files. Say &quot;set up my product&quot; and it looks at your code, researches competitors, scores potential customer segments using a weighted framework (pain, fit, budget, market size), and writes everything to markdown files you can review. When you need outreach copy, it writes messages based on your product and the specific person you&#x27;re reaching out to.<p>The whole thing is markdown files in a git repo. No app, no dashboard. Strategies are docs, progress is tables, and Claude Code ties it together through good instructions in CLAUDE.md. It&#x27;s structured knowledge plus product context plus AI execution, not magic.<p>I built it to solve my own problem and I&#x27;ve been using it to distribute itself, which is a little weird but it works. Got my first sale ever last week. $39 lifetime.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beyondfolder.com&#x2F;distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beyondfolder.com&#x2F;distribution</a><p>Happy to answer questions about the approach or the Claude Code setup.

Your source code never leaves your machine.<p>How it works:<p>- locus plan: AI generates a sprint plan by analyzing your codebase. It uses multi-agent roles to break down directives into structured tasks with complexity estimates and risk assessments. You can reject and iterate on plans before approving.<p>- locus run: An agent picks up tasks from the sprint, executes them sequentially on a single branch, auto-commits after each task, and opens a PR when the sprint is done. Supports both Claude and Codex as backends.<p>- locus review: Review that understands your full codebase, not just diffs. Detects bugs, security issues, and performance problems. Posts review comments directly to GitHub PRs.<p>- locus discuss: Have architectural discussions with AI that has full project context. Insights and decisions are automatically extracted and saved.<p>- Telegram bot: Manage your agent remotely from your phone.<p>- VSCode extension: Chat with AI in your editor with full repo context.<p>The whole system is free, self-hostable, and works with your existing GitHub workflow. There&#x27;s a one-command installation script for Ubuntu&#x2F;Debian&#x2F;macOS.<p>Tech stack: TypeScript monorepo with NestJS API, Next.js dashboard, and a Bun-bundled CLI.<p>I&#x27;m a solo developer building this because I was frustrated with the disconnect between planning tools and actual code execution.<p>Would love feedback on the approach and any features you&#x27;d want to see.",

Need a 2,000-word article? One click. Need an opinion? Ask a chatbot.<p>But here’s the problem: If everyone is using AI to write, why should we bother reading each other at all? We aren&#x27;t exchanging thoughts anymore; we are just swapping machine-processed data. Our way of thinking is becoming lazy.

      "body": "I&#x27;ve been building multi-agent AI pipelines and kept running into the same structural problem: agents are stateless by default. Every session restart discards everything they learned. In multi-agent systems it compounds — Agent-1 learns something Agent-2 will never know. I started calling it &quot;agent amnesia.&quot;\nAFS is my attempt to fix this. The central architectural decision is unusual: your filesystem IS the memory layer. There&#x27;s no separate database process to run, no cloud service to authenticate against. AFS stores memories as JSON files in a `.afs&#x2F;` directory, with SQLite FTS5 for full-text search, HNSW indices for vector similarity, and msgpack-encoded graph edges for relationships.\n*Three-tier memory lifecycle (automatic)*\nMemories auto-migrate without explicit management:\n- Working memory (&lt; 24h): raw observations, fast access, no compression<p>- Episodic memory: full history with provenance, searchable\n- Semantic memory: auto-consolidated knowledge (scheduler synthesizes patterns from episodic into generalizations like &quot;Auth module uses JWT, 24h expiry across all services&quot;)<p>You only store observations. The scheduler extracts the patterns.<p>*Multi-agent knowledge sharing*\nNamed swarm pools: Agent-1 shares a memory to a swarm ID, any agent querying that swarm ID gets it. No broker process, no coordination protocol — just shared files with file-locking.\n*Auto-built knowledge graph*\nGraph edges (`similar_to`, `co_occurred`, `consolidated_from`, `depends_on`) are discovered automatically during consolidation. You can query neighbors, mine for new connections, or traverse paths.<p>*Why filesystem over a vector database*\nA few deliberate tradeoffs:\n1. Inspectable by default — `jq .afs&#x2F;agents&#x2F;my-agent&#x2F;memories&#x2F;working&#x2F;<i>.json` is a valid debugging strategy\n2. Versionable — `git` your agent&#x27;s memory like any other project artifact\n3. Portable — rsync to another machine, it works\n4. Air-gap friendly — zero outbound calls\n5. No additional process — no Postgres, no Qdrant, nothing to manage\nTradeoff: less efficient at very large scale than a dedicated vector DB. Using HNSW (hnswlib) for approximate nearest neighbor — handles the cases I&#x27;ve tested (100k+ memories per agent, &lt; 100ms search).<p>*Audit trail*\nAll operations logged with standardized operation names, status (success&#x2F;error&#x2F;partial), and operation-specific payload. Fail-open — if audit logging fails, the operation continues.<p>*Status*\nUnder active development. APIs and behaviors change frequently.

      "body": "Hello HN!<p>We, a team of 2, built Subatix after one of us spent almost 6 years in big consulting and at certain point came to a thought like «90% of what consulting is usually data-analysis related, why not make smth so any business get same level of insights without externals and 6-figure+ checks and fast?!». Based the experience during every project everyone wants - fast answers from their data, but real ops&#x2F;business data is messy, sensitive, and hard to outsource to generic AI tools due to security and output quality reasons. Most analysis still ends up in Excel, SQL notebooks and then slide decks are stitched together manually. When AI tools appeared, they helped with text and ideas, but fell apart once real business data, traceability, or auditability mattered.<p>Subatix is an attempt to bridge that gap. It’s a desktop workspace (macOS and Windows already available) where you open your own business or operational data locally and ask about what bothers + pre-cooked structured multi stage business diagnostic flow. The system breaks the request into analysis steps, applies standard consulting-style methodologies (KPIs, variance analysis, loss trees, scenario logic, etc.), runs the calculations, and produces quantified findings and prioritized actions. All intermediate steps, assumptions, and calculations remain visible - so everything is traceable and can be verified + users’ raw data stays local, all calculations&#x2F;analysis done on the machine.<p>A few design decisions that make it different from most AI analytics tools:\n* Local-first by default: raw data stays on your machine. There’s no requirement to upload raw operational or financial data to a cloud service. In fact, users don’t even upload it anywhere. \n* Traceable outputs: every number is backed by explicit calculations, not just narrative summaries.\n* Method-driven: instead of free-form chat, the system applies structured analysis patterns used by big-consulting business analysts&#x2F;associates.\n* Human-in-the-loop: today the goal isn’t to replace, but to make methodologies and frameworks widely accessible and to compress the repetitive, time-consuming parts so people can focus on judgment and decision-making.<p>The tool exists today and is usable. You can find out more and download it here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.subatix.com&#x2F;hn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.subatix.com&#x2F;hn</a>  There is a trial available for all new users and also some copper production sample data available to play with - just hit the Analyze Sample Data once you configure Subatix on your machine.<p>We’re around in the comments and interested in feedback about both UI and UX - especially from people who do business analysis.<p>Happy to answer questions! \nThank you HN!<p>Alex and Vlad \n=(^_^)=",

      "body": "Hey HN,<p>I’m Lubos, a solo founder based in Slovakia. I’m building GlitchWard because I got tired of seeing SMBs and agencies running &quot;naked&quot; servers.<p>Most small teams ignore server security not because they don&#x27;t care, but because enterprise tools (Wiz, Datadog Security) are too expensive, and manual hardening (fail2ban, OS updates) eventually gets forgotten.<p>I wanted a tool that creates a &quot;self-defending&quot; server, capable of stopping attacks even when I&#x27;m asleep.<p>CURRENT STATUS: We officially launched yesterday. During our beta, we onboarded 20+ clients and the beacon is currently protecting 100+ servers. You can also check out our demo video and launch details on Product Hunt: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;glitchward\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;glitchward</a><p>We are currently supporting only Linux based operating systems (Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL...)<p>WHAT IT DOES: You install a lightweight beacon agent (Rust binary), and it provides:<p>Active Defense: It doesn&#x27;t just watch; it acts. We recently caught and killed a reverse shell attack in under 10 seconds. Read the analysis here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glitchward.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;anatomy-of-an-attack-how-we-caught-and-killed-a-reverse-shell-in-under-10-seconds\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glitchward.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;anatomy-of-an-attack-how-we-caug...</a><p>Important: All automated interventions are strictly regulated. The agent relies on multi-stage heuristic analysis and only executes active countermeasures when there is 100% certainty, ensuring it never interferes with legitimate workloads.<p>AI-Assisted Triage: Instead of cryptic logs, you get an instant analysis of what happened, why it matters, and how to fix it.<p>CIS Benchmarks &amp; CVE Scanning: Automated hardening checks against industry standards and vulnerability monitoring for OS&#x2F;NPM&#x2F;Composer packages.<p>THE TECH STACK &amp; &quot;WHO BUILT THIS&quot;: I have 15+ years of experience architecting massive e-commerce projects from scratch (My LinkedIn: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;eyeskiller&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;eyeskiller&#x2F;</a>).<p>The Core: The Rust beacon and backend logic are 100% human-written by me, prioritizing stability and resource efficiency.<p>The UI: Full disclosure—I&#x27;m a tragic web designer, so the frontend (Vue.js + Tailwind) was built with heavy AI assistance.<p>Compliance: We are fully GDPR compliant and our security architecture is aligned with NIST CSF 2.0.<p>The platform is live at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glitchward.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glitchward.com</a><p>LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK: I’m curious about your stance on Automated Response. Are you comfortable letting an agent kill processes automatically (given our strict confidence thresholds), or do you strictly prefer &quot;alert-only&quot; for production servers? (Note: GlitchWard supports both modes, so you can choose what fits your risk appetite).<p>If you want to try it out, I’ve created a coupon code HACKERNEWS for an 7-day trial - no credit card required (or just ping me at lubos@glitchward.com).<p>Thanks!",

      "title": "Show HN: How we solved the InfoSec adoption blocker for cloud tools",
      "body": "I&#x27;ve been building CleanCloud (open-source cloud cost scanner) and discovered the biggest adoption blocker wasn&#x27;t our feature set<p>It was InfoSec approval.<p><pre><code>  The Problem: The Code Audit Wall\n\n  Every enterprise we talked to had the same process:\n  1. SRE team loves the tool, wants to use it\n  2. InfoSec requires security review before production use\n  3. Security team must audit the entire codebase to verify read-only claims\n  4. Process takes 2-4 weeks (or gets stuck in backlog indefinitely)\n\n  One CISO told us: &quot;I don&#x27;t care if your README says &#x27;read-only&#x27;. I need to verify you&#x27;re not calling DeleteBucket() anywhere in 10,000 lines of Python.&quot;\n\n  Fair point. But this kills adoption velocity.\n\n  The Insight: Don&#x27;t Ask Them to Trust Your Code\n\n  The breakthrough came from asking: &quot;Who do InfoSec teams already trust?&quot;\n\n  Answer: AWS and Azure. They already trust the cloud provider&#x27;s IAM enforcement.\n\n  So instead of asking them to audit our code, we provide:\n\n  1. A 30-line JSON IAM policy (read-only by design)\n  2. A verification script they can run to prove it&#x27;s safe\n  3. OIDC setup (GitHub Actions) with no stored credentials\n  4. Runtime safety tests that fail if we call forbidden APIs\n\n  The IAM Proof Pack: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cleancloud-io&#x2F;cleancloud&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs\n\n  The Result\n\n  InfoSec teams now audit a 30-line JSON file instead of our entire codebase. Trust is enforced by AWS&#x2F;Azure IAM, not by promises in our README.\n\n  A colleague who reviewed it said:\n  &gt; &quot;I specifically love the IAM Proof Pack approach. By requiring a separate, verifiable Read-Only IAM role, you shift trust from your code to the Cloud Provider&#x27;s enforcement. They don&#x27;t have to audit your Python code line-by-line—they just verify the JSON policy is safe.&quot;\n\n  This reduced our InfoSec approval time from 2-4 weeks to same-day in several cases.\n\n  Technical Details\n\n  The approach works because:\n\n  1. **Verifiable IAM Policy**: The read-only policy is declarative, easy to audit\n     ```json\n     {\n       &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,\n       &quot;Statement&quot;: [{\n         &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,\n         &quot;Action&quot;: [&quot;ec2:Describe*&quot;, &quot;s3:List*&quot;, &quot;s3:GetBucketTagging&quot;],\n         &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot;\n       }]\n     }\n\n  2. OIDC-First: No long-lived credentials, temporary tokens only\n    - GitHub Actions → AWS STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\n    - Azure Workload Identity Federation\n    - Zero secrets stored in CI&#x2F;CD\n  3. Runtime Guards: Our test suite mocks AWS&#x2F;Azure SDKs and fails if forbidden methods are called\n  def test_aws_runtime_readonly():\n      with patch(&#x27;boto3.client&#x27;) as mock:\n          mock.return_value.delete_bucket.side_effect = AssertionError(&quot;Forbidden!&quot;)\n          scan_aws()  # Must not call delete_bucket\n  4. Static Analysis: AST parsing blocks dangerous imports&#x2F;calls at CI time\n\n  Why This Matters\n\n  If you&#x27;re building DevOps&#x2F;security tools that need cloud access, the &quot;trust me, it&#x27;s read-only&quot; approach doesn&#x27;t scale. InfoSec teams need verifiable guarantees, not promises.\n\n  Shifting trust from your code to the cloud provider&#x27;s enforcement makes security review tractable.\n\n  Open Questions\n\n  - Is there a better way to prove read-only behavior programmatically?\n  - How do other cloud tools handle InfoSec approval?\n  - Should this be a standard pattern for cloud security tools?\n\n  GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cleancloud-io&#x2F;cleancloud\n  Docs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cleancloud-io&#x2F;cleancloud&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;infosec-readiness.md\n\n  Happy to discuss the approach or share more details about what worked (and what didn&#x27;t).</code></pre>",

      "body": "Most AI tools generate text. Very few generate finished artifacts you can ship.<p>I expected the hard part to be prompt engineering. It wasn&#x27;t. The hard part is what happens after generation: enforcing structural invariants so the output is actually usable -- every section present, no &quot;coming soon&quot; placeholders, no layout that falls apart at export time.<p>I ended up treating LLM output the way a compiler treats source code: intent goes in, validated artifacts come out, deterministic rules sit between the model and the user.<p>Live at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gixo.ai\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gixo.ai</a> -- sample outputs on the homepage, no signup required. This post is about the engineering, not the product.<p>--<p>STYLE GUIDES AS COMPILER RULES<p>Every content type has a typed style guide -- required sections, structural constraints, quality checklists, which elements are mandatory vs. negotiable. Transformations between types (blog post to video script, guide to checklist) carry a Confidence score and explicit LostElements so the user knows what the conversion costs.<p>The LLM is the code generator. The style guide is the type system. Output that doesn&#x27;t satisfy the constraints fails -- a presentation deck missing its title slide or section dividers triggers bounded regeneration rather than silent acceptance.<p>WHY BLAZOR SERVER?<p>SignalR gives me real-time push for free, and server rendering means I access the database and message bus directly -- no separate API gateway.<p>The tradeoff: every user holds an open WebSocket. For a content tool where users are actively editing, the connection is already there and I use it for everything -- progress updates, collaboration, AI streaming.<p>The non-obvious gotcha: when a Blazor Server component calls its own &#x2F;api&#x2F; endpoint, the request doesn&#x27;t carry the browser&#x27;s cookies. I had to write a DelegatingHandler that forwards the auth cookie from the inbound HttpContext onto the outgoing request. Without it, every internal API call returns 401. I struggled to find clear documentation for this pattern.<p>AUTHORIZATION WITHOUT [AUTHORIZE] SPRAWL<p>Once you have dozens of controllers, policy decorators become invisible. I replaced them with a single middleware scoped to API routes that separates two concepts:<p>1. Permission (role-based): &quot;Is this user allowed to do this?&quot;\n2. Entitlement (subscription-based): &quot;Has this user paid for this?&quot;<p>If the entitlement service isn&#x27;t registered in production, the middleware denies access rather than silently making paid routes free. Fail-closed on billing -- you only add that after you discover the alternative.<p>THE OPS LESSON THAT COST ME A WEEKEND<p>Azure App Service recycles containers. If your DataProtection keys live in memory, every restart invalidates every auth cookie. The symptom: infinite login redirect loop plus a SignalR disconnect storm. I lost a weekend to this. Fix: persist keys to durable storage outside the container.<p>Separately: I applied rate limiting globally and immediately broke every real-time feature. It now excludes WebSocket paths.<p>HONEST TRADEOFFS I HAVEN&#x27;T FIXED<p>Auth is overengineered. Multiple generations of authentication coexist -- cookie sessions, JWT flows, two identity enrichment paths. An internal audit calls it &quot;overengineered in practice.&quot; I haven&#x27;t consolidated because the current system works and touching auth is terrifying.<p>CI doesn&#x27;t gate on tests. Build-and-deploy, not build-test-deploy. There are multiple test projects, but they don&#x27;t gate deployment yet.<p>Observability is incomplete. Structured logging is solid. Distributed tracing is on the list, not in the code.<p>--<p>Happy to answer questions about the architecture, the tradeoffs, or any of the things I got wrong.",

      "title": "BTDUex Safe? The Back End Withdrawal Anomalies",
      "body": "I’m posting this analysis to the YC community because I value the technical rigor here, and I need a sanity check on a platform that is aggressively marketing itself right now: BTDUex.<p>For context, I spent the first two decades of my career in enterprise IT systems administration, dealing with server infrastructure, database integrity, and network security before shifting to full-time independent trading. I’ve survived the dot-com vaporware era, the 2008 financial meltdown, and every crypto winter since Mt. Gox. My &quot;sysadmin gut check&quot; for systemic risk is highly attuned, and BTDUex is currently triggering every alarm bell I have.<p>I’ve been auditioning their operations from the outside in, looking past the polished React framework of their frontend. I believe what we are looking at is not a legitimate fintech disruptor, but a sophisticated, modern iteration of a financial &quot;honey pot,&quot; disguised by a high-latency Web3 wrapper.<p>Here is my technical breakdown of why the BTDUex architecture appears fundamentally fraudulent, specifically focusing on its critical failure point: the withdrawal logic.<p>1. The &quot;Withdrawal Logic&quot; Anomaly (The Architectural Smoking Gun)\nIn any legitimate fintech architecture—whether centralized finance (CeFi) like Coinbase or decentralized finance (DeFi) like Uniswap—withdrawal logic follows a standard pattern: transaction fees, gas costs, or taxes are netted internally from the user&#x27;s existing asset balance within the database or smart contract before the remaining funds are broadcast to the blockchain or wired to a bank.<p>When a user attempts to withdraw significant capital (often &quot;profits&quot; generated on the platform&#x27;s simulated interface), the request is flagged by a backend &quot;compliance&quot; layer. The user is then informed via API response or support ticket that to &quot;unblock&quot; the withdrawal, they must deposit an additional external sum (often cited as a 15%-30% &quot;tax&quot; or &quot;verification fee&quot;) via fresh USDT.<p>The Technical Implication:\nFrom a database integrity and systems standpoint, requiring external liquidity to unlock existing internal database entries is absurd.<p>If the user has $10,000 in their account and owes a $500 fee, a functional system executes Balance = Balance - Fee and sends the remaining $9,500.<p>BTDUex&#x27;s requirement for a new inbound transaction to release an existing balance suggests that the internal ledger balance is disconnected from real, available liquidity.<p>This mechanism is the defining characteristic of a Ponzi scheme in its exit phase, or what’s known in security circles as a &quot;pig-butchering&quot; scam. The backend isn&#x27;t connected to real liquidity pools; it&#x27;s likely just a local ledger showing simulated numbers. The request for a &quot;fee&quot; is functionally a ransom demand to release data that has no real value behind it.<p>2. The &quot;Wrapper Company&quot; Pattern\nBTDUex appears to be a classic &quot;wrapper company.&quot; They have invested heavily in the user interface layer—slick mobile responsiveness, real-time charting visualizations—to build immediate trust. However, the backend operations seem to be a black box operating in a regulatory vacuum.<p>If you attempt to trace their orders to an on-chain settlement or cross-reference their operating entities with major regulatory API endpoints (NFA, FCA, ASIC), you will find zero footprint. They are operating with the frontend aesthetics of a Tier-1 exchange but the backend compliance structure of a burner phone.<p>3. Operational Opacity as a Feature\nFurthermore, there is a noticeable pattern of convenient &quot;system maintenance&quot; events that lock users out during periods of high market volatility. While every platform has technical debt and downtime, the timing and lack of transparent, technical post-mortems from BTDUex suggest intentional throttling of user activity rather than legitimate infrastructure scaling issues.",

      "body": "Hey HN! I built Lumina – an open-source observability platform for AI&#x2F;LLM applications. Self-host it in 5 minutes with Docker Compose, all features included.<p>The Problem:<p>I&#x27;ve been building LLM apps for the past year, and I kept running into the same issues:\n- LLM responses would randomly change after prompt tweaks, breaking things.\n- Costs would spike unexpectedly (turns out a bug was hitting GPT-4 instead of 3.5).\n- No easy way to compare &quot;before vs after&quot; when testing prompt changes.\n- Existing tools were either too expensive or missing features in free tiers.<p>What I Built:<p>Lumina is OpenTelemetry-native, meaning:\n- Works with your existing OTEL stack (Datadog, Grafana, etc.).\n- No vendor lock-in, standard trace format.\n- Integrates in 3 lines of code.<p>Key features:\n - Cost &amp; quality monitoring – Automatic alerts when costs spike, or responses degrade.\n - Replay testing – Capture production traces, replay them after changes, see diffs.\n - Semantic comparison – Not just string matching – uses Claude to judge if responses are &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse.&quot;\n - Self-hosted tier – 50k traces&#x2F;day, 7-day retention, ALL features included (alerts, replay, semantic scoring)<p>How it works:<p>```bash\n# Start Lumina\ngit clone <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;use-lumina&#x2F;Lumina\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;use-lumina&#x2F;Lumina</a>\ncd Lumina&#x2F;infra&#x2F;docker\ndocker-compose up -d\n```<p>```typescript\n&#x2F;&#x2F; Add to your app (no API key needed for self-hosted!)\nimport { Lumina } from &#x27;@uselumina&#x2F;sdk&#x27;;<p>const lumina = new Lumina({\n  endpoint: &#x27;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:8080&#x2F;v1&#x2F;traces&#x27;,\n});<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; Wrap your LLM call\nconst response = await lumina.traceLLM(\n  async () =&gt; await openai.chat.completions.create({...}),\n  { provider: &#x27;openai&#x27;, model: &#x27;gpt-4&#x27;, prompt: &#x27;...&#x27; }\n);\n```<p>That&#x27;s it. Every LLM call is now tracked with cost, latency, tokens, and quality scores.<p>What makes it different:<p>1. Free self-hosted with limits that work – 50k traces&#x2F;day and 7-day retention (resets daily at midnight UTC). All features included: alerts, replay testing, and semantic scoring. Perfect for most development and small production workloads. Need more? Upgrade to managed cloud.<p>2. OpenTelemetry-native – Not another proprietary format. Use standard OTEL exporters, works with existing infra. Can send traces to both Lumina AND Datadog simultaneously.<p>3. Replay testing – The killer feature. Capture 100 production traces, change your prompt, replay them all, and get a semantic diff report. Like snapshot testing for LLMs.<p>4. Fast – Built with Bun, Postgres, Redis, NATS. Sub-500ms from trace to alert. Handles 10k+ traces&#x2F;min on a single machine.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for:<p>- Feedback on the approach (is OTEL the right foundation?)\n- Bug reports (tested on Mac&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;WSL2, but I&#x27;m sure there are issues)\n- Ideas for what features matter most (alerts? replay? cost tracking?)\n- Help with the semantic scorer (currently uses Claude, want to make it pluggable)<p>Why open source:<p>I want this to be the standard for LLM observability. That only works if it&#x27;s:\n- Free to use and modify (Apache 2.0)\n- Easy to self-host (Docker Compose, no cloud dependencies)\n- Open to contributions (good first issues tagged)<p>The business model is managed hosting for teams that don&#x27;t want to run infrastructure. But the core product is and always will be free.<p>Try it:\n- GitHub: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;use-lumina&#x2F;Lumina\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;use-lumina&#x2F;Lumina</a>\n- Docs: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.uselumina.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.uselumina.io</a>\n- Quick start: 5 minutes from `git clone` to dashboard<p>I&#x27;d love to hear what you think! Especially interested in:\n- What observability problems are you hitting with LLMs\n- Missing features that would make this useful for you\n- Any similar tools you&#x27;re using (and what they do better)<p>Thanks for reading!",

Before widespread LLM adoption I had to do a lot of research when writing code.<p>When replacing SWEs in the future gets discussed, a lot of people say things like &quot;Oh someone has to review the code&quot; and &quot;they&#x27;ll always need to be a human in the mix&quot;. But when are these humans supposed to acquire this knowledge?<p>Claude Code can help me create things a lot faster. I can vibe code stuff that would take me a lot of time to learn and build. But I understand none of it. When people talk about productivity, it seems like most gloss over the fact that those who already know how to do things &amp; have experience are going to be the most productive. Yet I often hear no discussion as to how people should be bridging the knowledge gap.<p>I am sure others make a deliberate effort to learn while they leverage these tools, but human beings are lazy. With the constant pressure to increase velocity &amp; productivity at all costs, people aren&#x27;t going to prioritize learning things. At work I already see SWEs &amp; people in technical roles taking the path of resistance:<p>- Asking copilot in agent mode to run a command instead of literally typing it themselves<p>- Suggesting a mermaid diagram for a large legacy system written in COBOL is accurate because &quot;that&#x27;s what the LLM said&quot;<p>- Making the statement that &quot;we really won&#x27;t need to understand data structures &amp; algorithms in the future, those problems are already solved&quot;<p>Doesn&#x27;t it seem like the era of AI is devaluing knowledge or talent and dressing it up as though it&#x27;s making people more productive in ways they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be?",

      "title": "What Your VPN Knows About You (and Why It Matters)",
      "body": "The Trust Problem with VPNs<p>With National Data Privacy Day approaching, I&#x27;ve been thinking about a fundamental contradiction in VPN privacy: every VPN asks you to trust them. But trust is antithetical to privacy. If you have to trust someone not to observe you, you don&#x27;t have privacy—you have their promise.\nHere&#x27;s a thought experiment: You&#x27;ve used a VPN for years because they promised not to keep logs. But how would you know if they were telling the truth?<p>The Promise Problem:<p>Every major VPN makes some version of &quot;we don&#x27;t log your activity.&quot; But these promises are, by design, unverifiable. You&#x27;re trusting a company&#x27;s word about what happens inside systems you can&#x27;t see.\nSometimes that trust is misplaced. In 2016, a VPN with a &quot;zero-logs&quot; policy provided detailed logs to law enforcement. In 2019, another disclosed a breach they weren&#x27;t forthcoming about. In 2021, a provider was acquired by a company with adware history.\nThe point isn&#x27;t that these companies are villains. It&#x27;s simpler: when privacy depends on trusting internal practices, you&#x27;re accepting uncertainty most users don&#x27;t appreciate. Policies can be violated. Companies get acquired. Jurisdictions issue subpoenas.<p>Policy vs. Architecture:<p>Imagine two hotels. At the first, management promises staff will never enter your room without permission. At the second, your room physically cannot be opened without your specific key—not by housekeeping, not by management, not by anyone.<p>Both offer privacy. But fundamentally different kinds. One is a policy. The other is a physical constraint.<p>Most VPNs operate like the first hotel. They promise not to look at your data, but their systems are technically capable of doing so. They&#x27;re just promising not to.<p>What if the system itself made certain violations impossible—not because of policy, but because of how it was built?<p>What&#x27;s Changing:<p>Two shifts matter. First, quantum computing&#x27;s impact on encryption. Today&#x27;s standards are secure against conventional computers, but quantum will eventually break many. NIST published post-quantum standards in 2024 for this reason. Sophisticated adversaries may be collecting encrypted data today intending to decrypt it later.<p>Second, passwordless authentication. Technologies like FIDO2 and passkeys are finally making passwords obsolete. Within years, typing passwords will feel as dated as carrying a Rolodex.\nBoth shifts point the same direction: security moving from trust-based systems toward cryptographic guarantees. Privacy should follow.<p>Verifiable Privacy:<p>Privacy claims should be auditable and provable. They shouldn&#x27;t require taking a company&#x27;s word.<p>This is what we&#x27;re building at Culper Systems. We call it &quot;Verifiable Lattice Privacy Architecture&quot; (VLPA). It&#x27;s designed so that user identity and network traffic are cryptographically separated at the architectural level. Even with full access to the infrastructure—even if you were an engineer working inside our company—you couldn&#x27;t correlate who a user is with what they&#x27;re doing online. It&#x27;s not a policy decision. It&#x27;s a mathematical constraint engineered into the foundation.<p>The question shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;does this company promise not to log my data?&quot; It should be &quot;is this system designed in a way that makes logging impossible?&quot;<p>When you rent a room with keys only you control, you don&#x27;t need to trust management&#x27;s intentions. You verify privacy by understanding how the system works. Digital privacy should offer the same possibility. The cryptography exists. The question is whether we&#x27;ll demand systems that prove their privacy claims rather than just assert them.",

After playing with time related concepts in various projects, I wanted to build an app of my own and made this using WebGL and React. This is my first ever app and I’m quite proud of this beta version.<p>Try the full experience for free in any browser. No ads, just a beautiful clock you can run in a tab, window, or PiP while working or studying. (One-time purchase unlocks saving custom themes, settings, and presets and is usable on the web, app, or screensaver.) You can start by trying out some of the different preset styles and then customizing it to your preferences.<p>Key features:<p>• Show&#x2F;hide seconds, 12&#x2F;24-hour toggle, pomodoro labels, sound effects, customizable flips, custom themes, positions, flap design, screen flashes on pomodoro phase end, a mini menu for controls, and so on<p>• Animated backgrounds, endless customization, and buttery-smooth flips<p>• GPU-optimized for ancient hardware and any device—yes, even obscure setups like smart speakers with screens or tiny PC monitors. Additional controls for frame rate, resolution<p>• A unique method to switch off the GPU when not needed and animate only on minute changes with a smooth gradual fade of the backgrounds.<p>It&#x27;s fast, responsive, and optimized to perfection. Building this took months of polish focusing on minute details that others may or may not notice and hair-pulling bugs with auth, databases, tokens, WebGL, and React quirks, but shipping it finally feels amazing and is very rewarding. Expect a lot more polish as we go.<p>I’d love to see how you customize it and run it in your spaces! Maybe you can upload it in the comments for others to see as well or email me at flipcloc@gmail.com.<p>There is a lot more coming soon including the addition of new styles, backgrounds, effects, functionality, clock styles, and more.  Hope some of you like it!<p>Feel free to try out and let me know if you have any feedback &#x2F; features you’d like to see for the app. I love feedback and try to ship fixes quickly! Shoutout to power user ChrisVN on Reddit for a ton of pomodoro&#x2F;stopwatch feedback that shaped it. Also happy to share from my small earned working knowledge of working with React, WebGL, Rust, Tauri, or Supabase if you have any queries.",

It creates three different solutions to the same problem in the same file. The architecture is technically valid but cognitively expensive.<p>Prompting for &quot;clean code&quot; didn&#x27;t help. The agents needed what I&#x27;d give a talented junior: a handbook on taste.<p>So I wrote doctrine files—markdown constraints that teach agents the difference between code that compiles and code that&#x27;s maintainable. Things like:<p>- &quot;More than 20 mutable state variables in a file? You have multiple modules pretending to be one.&quot;<p>- &quot;Three approaches to the same problem coexisting?

I have a WebMCP-enabled test app running in it.<p>The only thing the extension offers is connecting to the Gemini API via an API token and using that as the driver for the WebMCP app. I don&#x27;t understand this use case. If I wanted my app to consume API tokens I would have directly coded interoperation with the major providers with one of the thousands libraries that di exactly that.<p>What I do have are subscriptions to OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and GitHub Copilot. All the clients I use can connect to MCP servers. I thought: I have WebMCP enabled in Canary, so my browser will actually be an MCP server that gives access to the underlying WebMCP apps it is running. It turns out that no, of course that would be logical, but you can&#x27;t do that. Chrome exposes an MCP server, but it is only for controlling Chrome itself, like Playwright. It does not provide any bridging to WebMCP.<p>I then thought there would be an extension that does this, but the Chrome extension ecosystem is full of bullshit extensions from fraudsters who vibe-coded their way into trying to capitalize on the AI craze. There are no extensions for that. All of them want you to subscribe, or give them API tokens. Many of them have non-working websites. One option I see mentioned online is running Chrome in debug mode and exposing a remote debugging port. This is exactly what WebMCP was supposedly invented to avoid, so running your browser in a special way to expose it to complete control cannot be the right way to do this. I&#x27;m perfectly able to already do that without WebMCP.<p>Am I understanding it wrong? I understand the proposal is in its infancy, but I expect the <i>goal</i> of it to be at least clear. I don&#x27;t understand where it helps developers or users in any single way that wasn&#x27;t already available before.",

      "body": "After college, my friends scattered across time zones. We tried starting a podcast to stay in touch, everyone would record updates, uploads them to Google Drive, and we planned to eventually publish episodes.<p>We never published one. Turns out we didn&#x27;t want a public podcast, but &quot;the podcast&quot; gave us a reason to keep in touch and share stories&#x2F;thoughts.<p>Google Drive was terrible for our needs. Record in one app, then upload. No notifications, bad organization. The worst part was when responding to something specific, I&#x27;d have to manually timestamp it and repeat their point before commenting. Completely broke the flow.<p>So I built Roads Audio. Private audio messaging where you can reply to specific moments with timestamped comments. Conversations branch naturally instead of stacking linearly. The hardest technical problem was handling infinite nested timestamped threads and querying position in the conversation tree, then displaying that in a user-friendly UI.<p>I built with Flutter&#x2F;Django and have been working on it for a few years (here&#x27;s the original micro-podcasting launch: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37758099\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37758099</a>). Initially positioned as a podcast alternative, but I&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s really about staying connected through longer-form audio without immediate response pressure.<p>The app has evolved a lot over the years and I&#x27;m always looking for more feedback from people who are interested in async audio. I still use it regularly with the same friend group; if it seems interesting let me know what you think!",

      "body": "I built OPP (Open Provenance Protocol), an open standard for verifying whether an image was AI-generated even after screenshots, distortion, pixel fudging, compression, cropping, and re-uploads.<p>The problem: C2PA&#x2F;Content Credentials embed metadata in the file. Screenshot the image and the provenance is gone. AI detectors are probabilistic and unreliable.<p>OPP takes a different approach, an external fingerprint registry. When a generator creates an image, a 3-layer signature (SHA-256 + PDQ perceptual hash + CLIP ViT-L&#x2F;14 embedding) is registered in a central index. Anyone can verify an image by querying the index. The signature survives any transformation because it&#x27;s not embedded in the file. Think Shazam for images, but for provenance.<p>Matching pipeline: exact hash lookup → CLIP cosine similarity via Qdrant HNSW (sub-10ms at billions) → PDQ hamming distance enrichment.\nOnly verified AI generators can mint. Verification is open.<p>The interesting part (new feature): I designed and implemented &quot;Adaptive Variant Tracking.&quot; When a verification query finds a high-confidence fuzzy match (CLIP &gt; 0.92, PDQ distance &lt; 20), the system automatically mints a variant signature linked to the original. This means the registry &quot;learns&quot; the screenshot&#x2F;crop&#x2F;edit. The next verification of that same screenshot becomes an O(1) exact hash match instead of a costly vector search. The most viral&#x2F;circulated images (highest misuse risk) become the fastest to verify.<p>Looking for feedback on the protocol design and poking holes in the design approach.",

      "body": "Hi HN,<p>I built NoSpamPro because I was tired of &quot;spam blockers&quot; that required uploading my entire contact list or call logs to their servers just to work. Most current solutions are essentially data-harvesting tools disguised as security apps.<p>NoSpamPro is an Android SMS&#x2F;Call blocker designed with a privacy-first, local-only philosophy. It uses a hybrid 8-layer filtering system to handle threats without compromising your data.<p>How it works (The Engineering Side):<p>95% of the filtering happens on-device. The app follows a decision-tree logic to minimize battery impact and maximize privacy:<p>Local Heuristics: We use Room DB for instant lookups against known malicious prefixes, B-Codes (Business Sender IDs like B043), and user-defined Regex patterns.<p>B-Code Registry: A specialized layer that verifies official business codes to detect &quot;spoofing&quot; attempts common in banking fraud.<p>The AI Layer (Optional): This is where it gets interesting. If the local layers are inconclusive (e.g., a &quot;Likely Spam&quot; score), the app can use Gemini AI for contextual analysis.<p>Privacy Protocol: Before any text leaves the device, it is anonymized. We only ask the model: &quot;Is this intent-based spam?&quot;.<p>Zero-Log: We implemented a protocol where analysis results are returned and the source data is immediately vaporized. No logs, no archives.<p>Technical Stack:<p>- Language: 100% Kotlin.\n- UI: Jetpack Compose (Material 3).\n- Storage: Room Persistence Library.\n- Async: Kotlin Coroutines &amp; Flow.<p>Why use this instead of the system default? While Google’s default filter is decent, it often misses localized scams (like country-specific betting spam) and has limited customization. NoSpamPro gives you &quot;Advanced Protection&quot; toggles like:<p>Burst Protection: Detecting &quot;SMS Bomb&quot; attacks and silencing them.<p>De-shortening URLs: Analyzing the final destination of bit.ly&#x2F;t.co links within the app&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Browser.&quot;<p>International Guard: Blocking specific high-risk area codes while whitelisting others.<p>The app is currently available for Android.

I’m dealing with serious family problems at home, and I can’t keep investing time and mental energy into this like before. I have no users yet, zero, and growth has stagnated because I just don’t have the headspace or runway to push traction anymore.<p>I have infrastructure credits from cloud providers (2k on GCP and possibly up to 5k AWS credits once our LLP finalizes), but no team, no marketing, and no traction.<p>I know this sounds rough, but I want someone who actually can take this forward. Whether you want to pivot it, grow it, integrate it with your stack, or just build something on top of it.<p>Why might it actually matter?<p>Look at what’s happening in AI infrastructure right now. Companies solving even one slice of the AI problem are commanding huge attention and capital:<p>Mem0 raised $24M from top investors for building a memory layer for AI apps and has millions of API calls per quarter that’s after gaining adoption and traction.<p>Supermemory raised $3M+ in seed funding from well-known AI investors (like Google) for solving context and memory retention for LLMs.<p>These companies are similar in being infrastructural pieces for AI development, and they got real investment because they showed either product adoption or market fit.<p>I don’t have that yet, but the foundations are there - SDKs, console, backend logic, CMS, design and a clean landing site.<p>What I’m offering\nIf you are interested in:<p>Full backend repo (just ask)<p>Frontend console (fully available)<p>CMS stack<p>SDKs in Python and TS<p>Website + branding<p>Cloud credits available to deploy … we can talk.<p>This isn’t a $20M product right now. It’s not even a $200k product as is. But it could be something with direction and effort. I’m realistic about that.<p>Why I’m writing this here?<p>I’m not looking for likes or hype. I need honest advice or a potential handover. I’d be glad to share everything, chat about ideas, or negotiate what makes sense. I genuinely think someone with time and focus could take what exists here and make it into something real.<p>If you have thoughts, interest, or know someone who might, please comment or DM.<p>Thanks for reading.",

RTX 4080!) while ignoring mission fit (do I really game that often?)<p>• Fleshes out hard constraints that sometimes come up until after purchase (bought Windows laptop, needs a way to support a MacOS app)<p>• Future-proofing: ensuring I won’t pay feature I&#x27;ll statistically never use<p>• Aims to parse through the noise (SEO type posts) and get you a great first-pass research report of what you should value and why.<p>Consumer purchases don&#x27;t need full enterprise rigor, but they deserve better than &quot;Top 10 Laptops 2026&quot; affiliate listicles or chatbots hallucinating specs.<p>How the framework works:\n1. Mission definition: What must work reliably? (Video editing vs office work vs travel)<p>2. Hard constraints: Binary gates (budget ceiling, OS requirements, battery minimums)<p>3. Candidate generation: AI searches current market without SEO or affiliate bias<p>4. Weighted scoring: Performance, battery, reliability, portability—you control the weights<p>5. Efficient frontier: Which options dominate? Which are just expensive?<p>6. Sensitivity analysis: &quot;If battery life matters 25% instead of 15%, MacBook Air wins. If reliability matters more, ThinkPad wins.&quot;<p>The PDFs include example case studies I’ve developed: policy analyst choosing ThinkPad X1 Carbon over MacBook Air (why reliability and docking beat battery life for enterprise work), freelance designer choosing Figma over Affinity Designer (why collaboration features justified 6x higher cost), consultant choosing Obsidian over Notion (why offline-first beat ease-of-use).<p>No barriers: No sign-up. No account. You get a PDF with prompts and case studies. Open ChatGPT or Claude (free version works), paste the prompt, answer questions. That&#x27;s it.<p>I built this because I was tired of seeing people (and myself) wasting money on impressive-sounding specs that don&#x27;t match their actual workflow. If you&#x27;ve ever regretted a tech purchase 3 weeks later, this might help.<p>Try it (I&#x27;d offer it free but then I loose my IP):\n• Tech &amp; Electronics: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decisioncontrolworks.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;auzhsa\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decisioncontrolworks.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;auzhsa</a>\n• Software &amp; Subscriptions: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decisioncontrolworks.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;zaucxt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;decisioncontrolworks.gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;zaucxt</a><p>Curious what HN thinks—especially if anyone&#x27;s tried applying formal decision methods to everyday purchases.",

Just a few days ago, the introduction of Anthropic&#x27;s new offering crashed the stocks of many massive Indian IT companies.<p>I want to add that I have a strong affinity for math so I would likely do well in fields that leverage it.<p>So, given all this:<p>- Is majoring in computer science (or a CS-adjacent field) still a good idea for someone starting university now in your opinion?<p>- Do you think there are any other fields that would be a better bet?

This helps keep your inbox clean and reduces long-term spam. Once expired, the address can no longer receive emails.<p>- Do I need to sign up or create an account?\nNo sign-up required. Open the temp mail app, tap to generate an address, and start using it immediately. No registration, no passwords, no hassle.<p>- Can I use these addresses for important accounts?\nWe recommend using disposable emails for one-time verifications, free trials, newsletters, and untrusted signups. For important accounts like banking or healthcare, use your real email address.<p>- Are the emails private and secure?\nYes. Emails are stored temporarily and automatically deleted when addresses expire. We don&#x27;t store your personal information or track your usage patterns.<p>- Can I reply to emails sent to a disposable address?\nDisposable email addresses are receive-only. They are designed for one-way communication like OTPs, verification codes, and newsletters.<p>- Is the app free?\nYes, the temp mail app is completely free to use.

I originally created this library for another project when I was seventeen. Two years later, I have been putting off release for too long, and this library desperately needs other experienced hands.<p>The reason for this post is to get some urgent feedback on what syntax feels good and what doesn&#x27;t; to test that what&#x27;s currently added is working as intended (I am the only tester); and, crucially, to find other maintainers. I want this to be a long-term project, and maintainers would help smooth out the rough edges of my mistakes and hopefully keep this project going for a while.<p>I should note that this is sort of a preliminary release post since this library is still in its very early stages (lacking features), and I&#x27;m really just looking to get things into motion.

Every listing gets two scores from practitioners:<p>- Market Score (1-5): industry adoption and brand recognition\n- Value Score (1-5): actual value for money based on usage<p>You can browse by category (DAST, SAST, SCA, pentest services, bug bounty platforms, etc.), compare tools side-by-side, or look up alternatives to specific products.<p>A few things that might be interesting technically:<p>- Data lives in a Google Sheet, served via a PHP proxy as CSV, parsed client-side\n- Pages are dynamic SPA-style but with clean URLs for SEO\n- Each tool&#x2F;alternative&#x2F;category page generates its own structured data and meta tags from the CSV data at runtime\n- No framework, no build step. Plain HTML, CSS, vanilla JS<p>No accounts, no gated content, no pay-to-rank. Happy to answer any questions about the approach or the security tool landscape.<p>Stack: Apache, vanilla JS, Google Sheets as CMS, Let&#x27;s Encrypt<p>Follow-up Comment (if asked about data&#x2F;methodology)<p>The scores come from a combination of:\n- Gartner&#x2F;Forrester positioning for Market Score\n- Community sentiment (Reddit, HN, security forums) for both scores\n- Direct practitioner feedback from CISOs and security engineers\n- Pricing transparency and free tier availability for Value Score<p>We deliberately keep it simple with two 1-5 scores rather than trying to build a complex weighted system. The goal is to help someone go from &quot;I need a DAST tool&quot; to a shortlist of 3-4 options in under 5 minutes.<p>Open source tools like Nmap, OWASP ZAP, and Trivy tend to score 5&#x2F;5 on Value. Enterprise tools like CrowdStrike and Mandiant score 5&#x2F;5 on Market but lower on Value due to pricing.<p>Follow-up Comment (if asked about business model)<p>Right now it&#x27;s free with no monetization. Long term we&#x27;re considering:\n- Featured listings (clearly marked, doesn&#x27;t affect scores)\n- Lead gen for vendors (opt-in only, buyer initiates contact)<p>We won&#x27;t do pay-to-rank.

Tag once, applies everywhere.\n- Smart import — plug in an SD card and it instantly shows new vs. already-indexed files. One click to import only new stuff.\n- Working drive — mark your fast SSD as your editing drive, then one-click copy clips from archive drives when you&#x27;re ready to cut\n- Offline browsing — search, browse thumbnails, and tag clips from disconnected drives. It remembers everything.\n- DaVinci Resolve integration — send clips straight to Resolve&#x27;s media pool with tags as keywords<p>I built it for myself and I&#x27;m putting it out there to see if it helps anyone else.

      "body": "With all the home security cam privacy issues in the news recently, I thought I&#x27;d share my project.<p>For about 3 years, I self-hosted my security camera system on the Synology surveillance station. It fit a lot of my needs, but I hated the hardware lock in. I was getting more and more frustrated with Synology&#x27;s behavior, but I didn&#x27;t find any alternatives I liked better.<p>So on Christmas 2025 I decided to put Claude Code to the test. I fully transitioned to this about two weeks later. I&#x27;ve been running 14 IP cameras doing 24&#x2F;7 recording with live streaming and ML-powered detection.<p>The stack is FastAPI + React + PostgreSQL, orchestrated with Docker. Video is handled by FFmpeg with a single process per camera that does both live HLS streaming and MP4 recording simultaneously, so you don&#x27;t burn multiple RTSP connections per camera.<p>It runs YOLO11 via ONNX Runtime on live HLS segments (no extra RTSP connections needed), uses background subtraction to skip static frames, and has a finite state machine that tracks object arrivals, departures, and state changes rather than just firing &quot;person detected&quot; over and over. Each event gets a snapshot with bounding boxes and an extracted video clip. There&#x27;s also a Vision LLM integration that can describe what&#x27;s happening in a scene.<p>Storage uses a tiered system (hot&#x2F;warm&#x2F;cold) with automatic migration, so recordings age off from fast local storage to larger drives and optionally to S3 (that part is still in-progress).<p>It supports GPU acceleration but also runs fine in CPU-only mode.<p>I know nothing about React, I&#x27;ve never been a front-end developer, so that&#x27;s 99.99% Claude. I have edited some CSS though. I&#x27;ve personally done more work on the backend, but it&#x27;s still mostly Claude. This is currently running behind my home VPN only, so the user management&#x2F;authentication is kind of weak at the moment. I&#x27;d love feedback!",

      "body": "Hi HN,<p><pre><code>  I built gflow, a single-node GPU job scheduler as a lightweight alternative to SLURM. If you&#x27;ve ever shared a multi-GPU machine with teammates and dealt\n   with GPU conflicts, or just wanted a simple way to queue up training jobs overnight, this is for that.\n\n  The problem: SLURM is designed for clusters. Setting it up on a single machine is overkill, and most ML teams sharing a workstation end up with ad-hoc\n  solutions — checking nvidia-smi, shouting in Slack, or writing hacky bash scripts.\n\n  gflow gives you:\n\n  - Job queue with GPU-aware scheduling — auto-detects GPUs via NVML, handles allocation and sets CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for you\n  - Job dependencies — with AND&#x2F;OR logic, so you can chain training → eval → export\n  - Job arrays — for hyperparameter sweeps\n  - tmux-based execution — jobs run in tmux sessions, so you can attach to see live output, and they survive terminal disconnects\n  - Conda environment support — specify the env per job\n  - Webhook notifications — get pinged when jobs finish or fail\n  - SLURM-inspired CLI — gbatch, gqueue, gcancel, gjob — familiar if you&#x27;ve used SLURM, simpler if you haven&#x27;t\n\n  It&#x27;s a single Rust binary. Install via pip install runqd (pre-built binaries), cargo install, or grab a release from GitHub. Run gflowd init to set up,\n  gflowd up to start, and you&#x27;re scheduling jobs.\n\n  Example:\n  gbatch --gpus 2 --conda myenv python train.py --lr 0.001\n  gqueue\n  gjob log 1\n\n  Tech stack: Rust, Tokio, Axum (REST API), NVML, MessagePack for state persistence.\n\n  GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AndPuQing&#x2F;gflow\n\n  Happy to answer any questions.</code></pre>",

Everything happens on-device. Think of it as a local alternative to Context7.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on openground, an opensource and completely on-device tool that let&#x27;s you give controlled documentation access to your coding agents. Solutions like Context7 provide a source of truth for docs, but their closed-source data ingestion and querying pose security&#x2F;privacy risks. openground aims to give users full control over what content is available to their agents and how it is ingested. Find your library&#x27;s documentation source (git repo, sitemap, or local), add it to openground via the CLI, and openground will use a local embedding model and vector db (lancedb) to store your docs. You can then use the CLI to install the MCP server to your agent to allow the agent to query the docs via hybrid BM25 full-text and vector search.<p>Using fastapi docs as an example, it&#x27;s as simple as:<p>uv tool install openground\nopenground add fastapi --source <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tiangolo&#x2F;fastapi.git\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tiangolo&#x2F;fastapi.git</a> --docs-path docs&#x2F;\nopenground install-mcp --opencode # or --claude-code or --cursor<p>And the agent will have access to locally query the fastapi docs when needed.<p>Features that I&#x27;ve implemented so far:\n- docs indexing from git repo, sitemap.xml, or local directories\n- index specific docs for specific library versions for git sources\n- efficient updating of existing docs so your machine is not embedding the same content every time you update<p>This is still an early version, so expect breaking changes. Upcoming features I am working on:\n- daemon style command that updates docs on a schedule\n- project specific access control from the MCP server\n- docs &quot;registry&quot; to allow pushing and pulling of documentation embeddings to and from S3\n- lighter-weight package\n- better docs<p>Suggestions and PRs welcome!

Growing somewhat tired of clicking through profiles on YC and wanting a way to find co-founders that focused more on similar plans or ideas, I decided to build a free alternative approach where users find each other and connect solely through the semantic similarity of their venture ideas.<p>I hope this post is accepted since YC has its own co-founder matching, but I&#x27;m not advocating for people to leave it. I tink it&#x27;s complementary. Plenty of reasons to look for co-founders based on their skills, background, or location, but Indexed-Ideas fits in as a more efficient way to tap into what I view as your most natural pool of collaborators. People you don&#x27;t need to pitch to because they are already convinced. It also enables you to size up your ecosystem by seeing how many great minds out there are thinking alike. For founders who are overly secretive with their ideas this approach might also be more attractive since a highly similar idea is needed to find their profile. Let me know what you think.

      "body": "I&#x27;m a solo developer who&#x27;s been writing code for 26 years, mostly consulting work in computational geometry and CAD software these days.  A month or two ago I watched a YouTube video about using an AI agent as a resume assistant, and thought it sounded like a fun idea.  More importantly, it sounded like something I could actually learn to build quickly.<p>Around the same time my longest-running client, a small company that makes a SolidWorks plugin, needed a better way to handle technical support.  They&#x27;re a three-person shop--they don&#x27;t have a support team or an IT team. So I built them a chatbot: Flask backend, Anthropic API, and a hand-curated knowledge base built from their help files, a list of possible error messages I extracted from their code, and transcripts of their training videos.<p>It worked well enough that the owner was impressed, and that&#x27;s when it clicked: every small software company has this exact problem.  They&#x27;re too small for Zendesk, too busy to answer the same questions repeatedly, and too niche for generic solutions.<p>So I turned it into a platform.  You give me your documentation--whatever that happens to look like--I build your knowledgebase, stand up an agent on a subdomain of recursive.support, and you embed it on your site with a single iframe tag.  No JavaScript SDK, no backend integration.<p>The part I&#x27;m most interested in technically is the self-improvement loop.  The agent generates reports that review its conversations, identify gaps and trends, and propose specific knowledge base edits, presented as diffs the business owner can approve or reject individually.  It sometimes even suggests fixes and enhancements I roll back into the product to make it better.  The goal is that the agent gets measurably better over time without requiring the owner to manually curate anything.<p>There are five agents running right now: the original client&#x27;s technical support, a documentation agent for an open-source project I maintain (neat-python), a founding documents Q&amp;A at ask1787.com, the recursive.support visitor agent (dogfooding), and an AI resume agent that circles back to the video that started all of this.<p>I built ask1787.com, from idea to live deployment, in about nine hours, which is probably the best demo of what the platform can do at this point.<p>Tech stack: Python, SQLite, ChromaDB, Anthropic API (Claude Haiku &amp; Sonnet), DigitalOcean droplets. Each customer gets an isolated deployment.<p>Happy to answer questions about the architecture, the self-improvement loop, or the experience of building a SaaS product as a side project while juggling 50 hours&#x2F;week of client work.<p>On the actual business side, I have one paying customer--the original client whose support problem started all of this.  Their contract covers most of the hosting costs for the entire platform, which means I can be patient about growth instead of desperate for it.<p>Fair warning: the product is live but early. So far my traffic consists mostly of people asking the agent to make them a hot anime girlfriend, so there&#x27;s clearly some product-market fit work left to do.",

      "body": "New project!<p>I just built the first version of Nebark, an A&#x2F;B testing platform for LLM system prompts. It aims to solve a very specific pain point: tracking prompt performance without forcing developers to wire trace IDs all the way through their backend to their frontend.<p>The Problem\nIf you want to know which system prompt variant generates better user feedback (upvotes, downvotes, or copy-to-clipboard events), the standard approach is intrusive. You have to generate a trace ID in your backend, pass it down to your client, attach it to your UI components, and send it back to your analytics DB. It creates friction and litters your API responses with telemetry metadata.<p>The Solution: Context Hashing\nWe decoupled the telemetry entirely using what we call &quot;Context Hashing&quot; to bridge the backend and frontend asynchronously.<p>Here is how the architecture works:<p>The Proxy (Backend): You point your OpenAI baseURL to our gateway. We intercept the request, inject Variant A or B of your system prompt, and stream the response back. Once the stream closes, our proxy calculates a unique cryptographic hash based on the interaction&#x27;s content and stores it as a blind trace.<p>The SDK (Frontend): A lightweight vanilla JS script watches the DOM. It smartly waits for the AI&#x27;s response to finish streaming and rendering on the screen. It then extracts the visible text and calculates the exact same unique hash locally, without intercepting any network traffic.<p>The Match: The SDK injects the feedback UI (&#x2F;). When a user clicks, the frontend sends this calculated Hash and a local Session ID to our DB. We match this Hash against the Proxy&#x27;s traces to attribute the vote to the correct prompt variant.<p>Why it’s interesting<p>Zero Backend Config: You only change the base URL. The backend remains completely unaware of the A&#x2F;B test or the telemetry.<p>Semantic Caching Immunity: If your backend uses Redis to serve a cached response and skips our Proxy, the frontend will generate a Hash that doesn&#x27;t exist in our DB. It naturally prevents skewed A&#x2F;B data from cached hits.<p>The Edge Cases (Where I need your feedback)\nThe biggest risk with DOM hashing is hydration&#x2F;rendering discrepancies. If a client&#x27;s frontend uses an aggressive Markdown parser that strips out specific characters before rendering the text, the frontend hash won&#x27;t match the proxy hash. We built a strict internal normalization engine on both ends to mitigate this, but it is an ongoing challenge.<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on this architecture. Is there a glaring edge case with DOM extraction or SSE proxying that I’m missing? Its free for now. Tear it apart.",

Real-time probability estimates for everything from tonight&#x27;s NBA games to whether Bitcoin will be up in 5 minutes. But the data is fragmented with no unified way to search it.<p>We trade prediction markets everyday and needed a smarter way to search across all of them. We started by ingesting everything into Postgres and writing SQL. Then we built a Claude wrapper that queries the DB in plain English. Type a question, get structured results. That actually worked and felt like what search should be. But the answers were only as good as the data, and the data was a mess.<p>The core problem: Both platforms structure their data completely differently. One NBA game on Kalshi is dozens of separate contracts, each with its own ticker. Polymarket has the same game as a handful of contracts with different naming. One says &quot;Cleveland,&quot; the other says &quot;Cavaliers.&quot; You can&#x27;t search across any of it without cleaning it up first.<p>So we built a pipeline to clean the data and classify it properly. Every market goes through it. Structured parsing for the predictable stuff, LLM for free-form titles&#x2F;description the rules can&#x27;t handle. New markets get picked up and classified within minutes.

      "body": "Hi HN,<p>I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in addressing data querying challenges organizations face.<p>I know a few people who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves. Specifically, the BigQuery Data Analytics and BigQuery Conversational Analytics extensions to the Gemini CLI enable self-service answers to both questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries, or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.<p>Unfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that limit their ability to drive this empowerment, and this project seeks to address them.<p>One is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.<p>The second is a lack of safe access control. There&#x27;s a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren&#x27;t well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.<p>BigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.<p>Code here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stevenwinnick&#x2F;big-ask\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stevenwinnick&#x2F;big-ask</a><p>I’d love any feedback on the project, especially from anyone who works or has worked somewhere where this could be useful.

      "body": "Today we’re open-sourcing the core memory engine behind Mnexium.com : CORE-MNX<p>GItHub (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mnexium&#x2F;core-mnx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mnexium&#x2F;core-mnx</a>)\nNPM (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;@mnexium&#x2F;core\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;@mnexium&#x2F;core</a>)<p>For us, this is a product decision and a philosophy decision.<p>Memory infrastructure is becoming foundational for serious AI products, and we believe the core layer should be transparent, inspectable, and extensible by the teams building on top of it. We also just want feedback - we want to build the best memory system given the tools we have access to today. We also want to make LLMs perform better then they already do OOTB.<p>CORE-MNX is the backend layer that powers durable memory workflows:\n    memory storage and retrieval,\n    claim extraction and truth-state resolution,\n    memory lifecycle management, and event streaming for real-time systems.\n    It’s Postgres-backed, API-first, and built to integrate into real production stacks.<p>We tried our best to make this system as standalone as possible. Ultimately, its fairly difficult we needed LLMs (Cerebras for fast token output, ChatGPT for intelligence etc), Databases for storage etc. We have intentionally made the project API interfaced so your project can be code agnostic.<p>Open-sourcing CORE lets builders:\n    understand exactly how memory behavior works,\n    self-host or extend the engine for their own products,\n    and avoid reinventing the same memory infrastructure from scratch.<p>What stays on Mnexium.com\nMnexium’s long-term direction is still the same: make AI systems more useful over time through durable memory and reliable recall. We&#x27;ve just figured out that hosting memory isnt the moat we once thought it was - the real moat we believe is making the LLM system(s) as easy to use as possible. The feature-set we&#x27;ve built around memory is what is differentiating.<p>Open-sourcing CORE is how we make that foundation available to everyone building in this space. Open to everyone to lend an opinion on improvements and how we make this problem solvable.<p>Would love feedback, opinions and bugs you may find. We release it isn&#x27;t perfect, but certainly a good start we&#x27;d love to improve upon.",

I sometimes struggle to find the root cause for the slow running queries and sending to LLM most of the time doesn&#x27;t have good result. I think the reason is LLM doesnt have the context of our database, schemas, explain results .etc.<p>That is why I decided to write a tool that gathers all infor about our data and suggest meaningful improvements including adding indexes, materialized views, or simply rewriting the query itself. The tool supports only PostgreSQL and MySQL for now , but you can easily fork and add your own desired database.<p>You just need to add your LLM api key and database credentials. It is an open source tool so I highly appreciate the review and contribution if you would like.<p>Feel free to check it out : <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SubhanHakverdiyev&#x2F;OptimizeQL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SubhanHakverdiyev&#x2F;OptimizeQL</a>",

By giving access to a clone of the infrastructure, agents can explore, run commands, test things before writing the IaC, giving them better context and a place to test ideas and changes before deploying.<p>I got the idea after seeing how much Claude Code has helped me work on code, I thought &quot;I wish there was something like that for infrastructure&quot;, and here we are.<p>Why not just provide tools, skills, MCP server to Claude Code?<p>Mainly safety. I didn&#x27;t want CC to SSH into a prod machine from where it is running locally (real problem!). I wanted to lock down the tools it can run to be only on sandboxes while also giving it autonomy to create sandboxes and not have access to anything else.<p>Fluid gives access to a live output of commands run (it&#x27;s pretty cool) and does this by ephemeral SSH Certificates. Fluid gives tools for creating IaC and requires human approval for creating sandboxes on hosts with low memory&#x2F;CPU and for accessing the internet or installing packages.<p>I greatly appreciate any feedback or thoughts you have, and I hope you get the chance to try out Fluid!",

      "body": "&gt; This shift coincided with a decrease in adjective TTR below a defined threshold, occurring approximately ten years before Pratchett’s formal diagnosis.<p>The diagnosis was announced in 2007, meaning the shift occurred in 1997. 1997 was after Jingo and before Carpe Jugulum and The Last Continent, and 2007 was after Making Money and before Unseen Academicals.<p>The Last Continent is the first identified in the paper as below the cutoff for adjectives which they use to identify the start of the decline.<p>My own feeling is that many of his strongest works were before 2000, though he had several excellent ones after (the City Watch and first two Moist von Lipwig; I know the ongoing Tiffany Aching series are good, but in terms of writing I found them not as intricate as his earlier books.) I found Snuff harder to read, and Raising Steam, sadly, very difficult. I could tell the genius was there, but my memory of the writing was that it used much longer sentences, had less intricate plotting, and far fewer puns and wordplay. It was this book that made me really feel a sense of grief for what was happening to him, and it was this one where I first felt there was an observable threshold that was crossed.<p>I have sometimes wondered if it would be respectful if another author was brought into assist in editing or rewriting his last two novels. I know his unpublished works were destroyed, and any writing assistance is not his own voice. Yet I feel, in a sense, seeing books with such clear decline could in itself have let his legacy down. I don&#x27;t know what his own view was or would be. While I admire Sanderson&#x27; continuance of the Wheel of Time, I would not wish such a drastic change in tone for some similar effort for the last of Pratchett&#x27;s works. Yet I deeply wish that his last books were, somehow, different, more representative of him that I feel they were, in that his illness (in a sense, of course!) let him down. They cause me sadness.<p>GNU Terry Pratc",

I needed to know what time it was and I wanted health integration, but I never used notifications mirroring and hated that my device had a screen at all. After evaluating how much I cared about the non-clock features versus how thick smartwatches are and that they require charging approximately daily to bi-weekly, I ended up switching to a classic watch instead. The design of it is so Apple-like that when I visited the UFO in Cupertino to pick up a tablet, the worker looked at my watch and then asked me if I’d retired from Apple. The watch hands are nearly invisible unless I’m looking at them. It’s everything I want from a wrist clock and nothing more.<p>In an ideal world, the smartwatch I want is thin. Thick watches will get smashed into door frames and walls and tables by my clumsy body, and I tire of it so greatly that I gave up on it. I evaluated fitness watches but I don’t rigorously exercise outdoors in the appropriate patterns, so they’re generally a waste of my money and effort to keep charged. I am truly sad that Fitbit got destroyed because their form factor was very appealing. I think this is the one thing that the post doesn’t address: smartwatches don’t <i>have</i> to be chonky. And yet. Sigh.<p>I do extremely miss how natural it felt having Apple Pay on my wrist, but my phone is not less usable in any meaningful way for that task.<p>So, yes, this article resonates. I would never voluntarily have a Samsung account for any reason, and I’ve known for decades that Google is fool’s gold — hi from ETcon ‘03, years after they hoovered up and then substiturd for Usenet and Webrings.

Bad code making it into updates is not the fault of any new tools, nor (in the past) of unqualified developers since, frankly and simply, the review process should have caught all of these.<p>Mac OS can be buggy and occasionally is a bit annoying in my case (Tahoe though is actually rather stable besides a few visual glitches for me, surprising considering a lot of my peers are having more issues with it over 25) but I have yet to see it fail to boot solely due to an update.<p>Linux distros like Silverblue have never been broken due to an update in my experience (though there are famous examples like what happened a while back with PopOS). With immutable distros like Silverblue, even if you intentionally brick the install (or an update does break it), you just select the OSTree prior to the change and resolve any issue instantly.<p>For an OS one is supposed to pay for both with money and by looking at ads, Windows has been in an inexcusable state long before LLMs were a thing. Considering such major, obvious issues as &quot;system doesn&#x27;t start anymore&quot; have been falling through code review for over a decade now, imagine what else has fallen through the cracks...<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F",

The convincing conscious perception of a feeling may be misinterpreted to an extent. Anger is an emotion that can often become misdirected. Supposedly, sexual arousal can be interpreted in translation from fear[0].<p>Someone who is suicidal may consider suicide seriously, but feel an urge to live in the process of suicide. Circumstance may make certain feelings clear, but by examining removed from circumstance, the person had the capacity for both feelings. There is some &quot;essence&quot; to the person that those feelings, brought on by circumstance, only scratch the surface of. Observing a narrow range of circumstances and assuming it is the essence is a mistake.<p>I think that more or less every person, in their essence, understands human decency. It may be that some people truly don&#x27;t have the capacity to appreciate it (thought: aliens?), but usually, I think the real culprit is learned behavior through various factors, and innate cognitive biases. I don&#x27;t mean to say that it is easy to change people, because the opposite is generally true, but I think it is worth thinking about.<p>That said, if there was someone who truly needed to, say, murder the way we need to eat, I say that they would do no wrong by murdering, but that we would do no wrong by apprehending them.

Readers that half understand vacuum flasks &#x2F; dewars: no or fewer gas particles in a vacuum means no or less energy those particles can collectively transport, that is correct but ignores the measures taken to prevent radiative heat loss. For example if the vacuum flask wasn&#x27;t mirror coated but black-body coated then 100 deg C tea isolated from room temperature in a vacuum flask is roughly 400 K versus 300 K, but Stefan Boltzmann carries it to the fourth power (4&#x2F;3) ^ 4 = 3.16 ! That vacuum flask would work very poorly if the heat radiated from the tea side to the room-temperature side was 3 times higher than the heat radiated by the room temperature side to the tea-side. The mirroring is <i>critical</i> in a vacuum flask. A lot of people think its just the vacuum effect and blindly generalize it to space. Just read the myriad of comments in these discussions. People seriously underestimate the capabilities of radiative cooling because the few situations they have encountered it, it was intentionally minimized or the heat flows were balanced by equilibrium, not repres",

It was too much hassle to keep it around.<p>To get it onto one&#x27;s system, a bootstrapping step is required. Either building gcc 9 (and only gcc 9) with D support, then using that gcc to bootstrap a later version, or bootstrapping dmd with itself.<p>In the former case I&#x27;m already having to bootstrap Ada onto the system, so D just adds another level of pain. It also doesn&#x27;t support all the same architectures as other gcc languages.<p>In the case of dmd, last I checked they just shove a tarball at you containing vague instructions and dead FTP links. Later I think they &quot;updated&quot; this to some kind of fancy script that autodownloads things. Neither is acceptable for my purposes.<p>I just want a simple tarball containing everything needed with clear instructions, and no auto downloading anything, like at least 90% of other packages provide. Why is this so hard?<p>Tip: pretend it&#x27;s still the BBS days and you are distributing your software. How would you do it? That&#x27;s how you should still do it.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried the LLVM D compiler, and at this point quite frankly I don&#x27;t want to waste any more time with the language, in its current form at least--with apologies to Walter Bright, who is truly a smart and likeable guy. Like I said, it&#x27;s regrettable.<p>The only way to revive interest in D is through a well planned rebranding and marketing campaign. I think the technical foundation is pretty sound, but the whole image and presentation needs a major overhaul. I have an idea of how to approach that, were there interest.<p>The first step would be to revive and update the C&#x2F;C++ version of the D compiler for gcc so as to remove the bootstrapping requirement and allow the latest D to be built, plus a commitment to keeping this up to date in",

The impracticality is the point.<p>When you keep asking me to name an alternative, you’re implicitly assuming I’m advocating for some incremental migration or deployable fix inside the current ecosystem. I am not. There isn’t one. If you want whole system static guarantees, you need a database that is designed from the beginning to be part of the same language and type system as the application.

      "body": "&gt;When they turned LIGO on i wanted to see warp drives whipping around. But all we saw was distant black hole mergers; interesting but not exactly a star trek moment.<p>• The LIGO methodology is to look for hyper-specified patterns in voluminous reams of apparent &#x27;noise&#x27;.  It wouldn&#x27;t be unfair to call it an extensively aggravated search for what one is looking for.  That&#x27;s okay, so long as they provide the stats to back up the non-noisiness of what they turn up. (I&#x27;m not a stats person and can&#x27;t debate that, and. I trust their caliber enough that I don&#x27;t feel the need to).  But to your point, if there are other signatures lurking in LIGO data _that they don&#x27;t know already how to look for_, then there is no reason why a paper would have gotten produced describing it since the first GW detection in 2015.<p>• Now, take this for what it&#x27;s worth in terms of fragmentary information relaying - But at the first Sol Symposium in 2023 at Stanford, I can tell you that in podium-level banter between talks (perhaps it was Q&amp;A and the like IIRC) it was asserted that the LIGO consortium was not allowing studies (read: not allowing access to its data) where the investigator&#x27;s intension was related to UFO &#x2F; UAP phenomena (like, extrapolating here, looking for signatures correlated with external reports of UAP sightings).  If that claim was borne out, than perhaps the LIGO consortium is just doing preemptive reputation protection in not allowing such studies to kick off with its name associated with it. (One could attempt to follow up with astronomer Beatriz Villaroel for a lead on who said that or if there&#x27;s substance to that research policy claim)<p>But my point is, between these two bullet points, you are afforded a complete &#x27;empty set&#x27; - and decidedly not a &#x27;negative result&#x27; - on whether or not LIGO has detected signatures of a &#x27;warp drive&#x27; or other some such non-prosaic phenomenon.",

E.g. static vs. dynamic dispatch, or the Box&#x2F;Rc&#x2F;Arc progression in Rust. If a certain subroutine or object requires the more general access even once, you pay the higher price almost everywhere. In Java, the situation is opposite: You use a more general construct, and the compiler picks an appropriate implementation <i>per use site</i>. E.g. dispatch is always logically dynamic, but if at a specific use site the compiler sees that the target is known, then the call will be inlined (C++ compilers sometimes do that, too, but not nearly to the same extent; that&#x27;s because a JIT can perform speculative optimisations without proving they&#x27;re correct); if a specific `new Integer...` doesn&#x27;t escape, it will be &quot;allocated&quot; in a register, and if it does escape it will be allocated on the heap.<p>The problem with Java&#x27;s approach is that optimisations aren&#x27;t <i>guaranteed</i>, and sometimes an optimisation can be missed. But on average they work really well.<p>The problem with a low-level language is that over time, as the program evolves and features (and maintainers) are added, things tend to go in one direction: more generality. So over time, the low-level program&#x27;s performance degrades and&#x2F;or you have to rethink and rearchitect to get good performance back.<p>As to memory locality, there&#x27;s no issue with Java&#x27;s approach, only with a missing feature of flattening objects into arrays. This feature is now being added (also in a general way: a class can declare that it doesn&#x27;t depend on identity, and the compiler then transparently decides when to flatten it and when to box it).<p>Anyway, this is why it&#x",

What is their purpose? What is social hierarchy <i>for</i>?<p>Let&#x27;s be frank. Most title chasing is pure vanity. There is no substance in the chase. It&#x27;s a game that takes schoolyard stupidity and flavors it with &quot;adult&quot; respectability.

To serve the workers he manages so that they can do <i>their</i> jobs which are also in the service of someone else. Why is there a king or a president? To serve the common good according to his station. We elevate for service. If someone has more to give and the necessary character to do it well, ideally, we elevate him according to his good so that he can better serve according to the good he has instead of allow that good to rot on the vine. It is service that makes sense of social hierarchy. Social hierarchy is about gift. It&#x27;s what makes a society a society.<p>In a tyrannical, upside down world, hierarchy is about domination and exploitation, about taking.

They have tens of millions of lines of code, far more than operating system kernels. The more lines of code, the more bugs. They include features you don&#x27;t need, with no easy way to disable them or opt-in on a case-by-case basis. The more features, the more an attacker can chain them into a usable attack.

Because they mutated into an application platform that&#x27;s easy to use and easy to deploy. But it&#x27;s a dysfunctional one. You can&#x27;t download and verify the application via signature, like every other OS&#x27;s application platform. There&#x27;s no published, vetted list of needed permissions.

Let me input everything I have, then as I pull ingredients out of the fridge I just &quot;decrease eggs by 3, decrease butter by 1tbsp, decrease bacon by 2 slices&quot; then over time, it will just build my shopping list for me etc. I even built a requirement list and spent a year implementing my own thing.<p>Given the number of apps put there, from dozens of OSS hobbyist apps to industrial resturant inventory management ones, I wan&#x27;t alone in thinking this is a solved problem and someone should just have the perfect interface for it. Between auto-unit converting apps, natural language processing apps, @cooklang, a million ideas about tracking pantries and ingredients and their categories, frequency of use charts, etc..<p>Then one time I went on a trip with a friend to his home town where we stayed at his parents house. His 78 year old mother had a 2 notepads attached to the fridge with a pencil on a string. As she worked in the kitchen, between washing hands she would just jot down random notes, cross others, doddles some on one notepad, and the other she would just add meal plans as she went along. Then when we were going to market she just ripped the page off.<p>Sounds so fucking simple and easy and I felt so stupid for the amount of effort I put trying to figure out the right app, the right device to mount on my fridge, how to connect power to it. How to make it not always on to blind me at night, but also so I don&#x27;t have to keep fiddling with it to unlock it. how to use it with wet fingers, how to keep translating units and &quot;catch up&quot; when I miss updating it for a couple of meals, how to hide ingredients I don&#x27;t care about and highlight ones I do, how to rearrange the interface.

Are the &quot;ipads&quot; at school giving the users &quot;unfettered access to the internet&quot;? That seems a bit irresponsible, however I would think that your ire should instead be directed towards the schools? Perhaps I&#x27;m misunderstanding?<p>&gt; In addition to the fact that phones are engineered to be addictive<p>Is it the phones or the content? I interpret your views as someone who should be campaigning for phones and other &quot;distractions&quot; to be restricted in a school environment, however the OSA and this VPN age check do not appear to tackle this.<p>&gt; there&#x27;s a huge problem with people addicted to phones and children are especially vulnerable<p>I will assume this is true for the sake of conversation. Similar to my previous query, how does the OSA or this VPN age check tackle this problem? Will banning certain types of content prevent this, or perhaps shift it? Instead of social media, would it be preferable if children were playing games on their phone? If they were then &quot;addicted&quot; to gaming or socialising around a popular game, would the proposal be at that point to ban children from playing games on their phone? To me, it seems the problem is less the content and more that the environment is setup in certain ways that allows this. It is unclear to me how banning and gating certain content will prevent this.<p>&gt; different campaigners care about different aspects, so I&#x27;m going to talk about the one I care about: addiction, destroyed ability to focus, and dopamine desensitization<p>What kind of things are you pushing outside of banning material and gating access?

Not for the marketing. Because these chips offer something no cloud GPU can: unified memory that runs serious models locally, privately, on your own machine.<p>Here&#x27;s what should make model builders pay attention: there&#x27;s going to be a full year between this generation and the next. A year where the new chip is the ceiling. A year where &quot;fits on the latest consumer silicon&quot; is the line between usable and irrelevant.<p>Something has shifted. People don&#x27;t just want to use AI; they want to own their AI. Models on their hardware, data on their machine. No API costs. No rate limits. No terms of service that change overnight. Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, OpenClaw; these aren&#x27;t niche experiments anymore. They&#x27;re how a growing segment of technical users interact with AI every day. And every single one is constrained by the same thing: how much model fits in memory.<p>This matters even more for social impact organizations.

There is a bunch of hardware running in your phone and a bunch of firmwares exposing it. Say your camera, or your wifi module, etc. If there is a security issue in the firmware of the camera, then it won&#x27;t be fixed in the AOSP codebase. You need the camera manufacturer to fix it and release a firmware, pass it to the phone manufacturer who will then deploy it on your phone.<p>Google split both of those concepts years ago in order to deploy Android updates faster and make everybody more secure, because manufacturers had a tendency to lag <i>a lot</i>. Some still do but the situation generally improved, I think. Anyway, you need to receive those security updates from your manufacturer because they are independent from Google.<p>&gt; the less is sounds like an alternative OS and more it sounds like a thin skin around whatever shit Google throws out, to be honest.<p>If you think that AOSP is shit, then sure. I mean, if you think that the Linux kernel is shit, maybe you don&#x27;t want to run a Linux distribution.<p>I personally think that AOSP is pretty great, and vastly superior to Linux on mobile (among other because it has a much better security model).

      "body": "I think that the main problem is that android has a lot of weird modifications that are not consistent with the rest of linux distros. The user data is suddenly in &#x2F;data instead of &#x2F;home, theres no package manager, no systemd (for better or worse), and there&#x27;s hella lotta security gotchas, for example call recording is impossible without root as far as I know. I&#x27;m not saying that Android is not hackable, but it&#x27;s a different type of hackability than desktop linux, you have to learn it all over again and in my opinion it&#x27;s much harder to master than desktop linux.<p>I&#x27;ve been on ubports for 3 years and while it also has some weird caveats like read only rootfs, no working package manager (due to read-only fs. however ubports has pretty cool support for lxc containers where you can use apt). Due to chronic lack of time I haven&#x27;t been able to sit down on my phone to play with it a bit (for example id like to install waydroid), but it seems a lot easier than android. For example, while there isn&#x27;t an app for call recording, some guy worked around it by writing a systemd user service as a workaround[1]. This is exactly the type of thing I&#x27;m thinking about when talking &quot;linux phone&quot;.<p>For me as a linux user, the difference if ubports was a human, I&#x27;d think that perhaps they were sick, whereas if android was a human, i&#x27;d shoot them in the face :)<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.ubports.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;75157\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.ubports.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;75157</a>",

      "body": "I think what confuses me is that Apple is taking so much profit that it reduces their profits.<p>It&#x27;s a classic direct-indirect management problem. Think about Android for a second. It costs nothing to put an app on their app store. People can make apps for themselves and then just publish because either &quot;why not&quot; or it&#x27;s an easy way to distribute to friends and family. So basically it is making app creation easy. Meanwhile Apple charges you $100&#x2F;yr to even put something up on the store, makes it hard to sideload, and consequently people charge for apps, which Apple rejoices as they get a 30% cut (already double dipping: profiting from devs, profiting from the devs&#x27; customers).<p>BUT WE&#x27;RE TALKING ABOUT SMARTPHONES<p>A smartphone is useless without apps! People frustrated they can&#x27;t find the apps they want on iPhone? They switch to Android. People on Android want to get away from Google but they can&#x27;t do half the shit they want to on iPhones (and the other half costs $0.99&#x2F;mo)? They bite their tongue or rage quit to Graphene.<p>The only reason this &quot;fuck over the user&quot; strategy works is because there&#x27;s an effective monopoly.<p>All of this is incredibly idiotic as the point of a smartphone is that it is a computer that also makes phone calls. We have made a grave mistake in thinking they are anything but general purpose computers. All our conversations around them seem really silly or down right idiotic when you <i>recognize</i> they are general purpose computers. And surprise surprise, the result is that seeing how profitable and abusive the smartphone market can be leads to a pretty obvious result: turn your laptops and desktops into smartphone like devices. Where everything must be done through the app stores, where they lock you out of basic functionalities, where they turn the general purpose computer into a locked down for-their-purposes computer.<p>The thing that made the smartphone and the compu",

It&#x27;s (1) will Google continue to invest resources to maintain it (and note they could easily make their commitment firm, and have chosen not to do so for obvious reasons: they value the optionality to stop support); and (2) if Google were to reduce&#x2F;end support, is there enough community, and by community we really mean companies with investments they can&#x27;t walk away from, to take over maintenance <i>and ongoing development</i> to maintain it as an sdk that can target the evolving platforms.<p>So whether Whirlpool or Toyota use Flutter is entirely irrelevant.  You can maintain in-car systems on private code, evidenced by how that was historically done.

I guess the grass is always greener in the other ecosystem ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>Idk, it just feels like OP chose all the wrong approaches with Rust, including using a separate language and ecosystem for the frontend, which is where most of the friction comes from. For example, Dioxus is a React clone that is somehow leagues better than React (and Next.js, too), and it has hot-reloading that brings compiles down to subsecond times, which makes building UI with it just as productive as with Node &#x2F; Vite etc. I use it for server side code as well and it&#x27;s great. Compilation times can be an issue with Rust, it&#x27;s something I miss from Go, but there are ways to improve on it, and just being smart about what deps you include, avoiding overuse of macros etc can make a difference. I know these things were not around when OP started using Rust for their application, but they are around now.<p>Node and TS are quite frankly inferior to Rust in most ways. Bad language, ecosystem full of buggy unmaintained packages with the worse security profile of all the common languages, no unified build tooling that seems to break your project every 6 months, constant churn of blessed frameworks and tools, an stdlib that is not much more comprehensive than Rust&#x27;s and outright broken in some ways, at least three different approaches to modules (esm, commonjs, umd, and more...?), I could go on an on. There is a reason why everyone seemingly reinvents the wheel in that ecosystem over and over again -- the language and platform is fundamentally not capable of achieving peoples goals, and every solution developed comes with massive tradeoffs that the next iteration attempts to solve, but that just creates additional issues or regressions for future attempts to tackle.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Rust with Dioxus and was comp",

They started sending wrong information, making promises we couldn&#x27;t keep, and handling complaints badly. When I tried to figure out what happened, I had scattered logs across services with no way to prove what the agents actually said.\nAIR is a flight recorder for AI systems. It&#x27;s an OpenAI-compatible reverse proxy (written in Go) that sits between your code and your LLM provider. Every prompt, completion, and tool call gets recorded with HMAC-SHA256 tamper-evident audit chains — modify one record and the chain breaks.\nWhat makes this different from Langfuse&#x2F;Helicone&#x2F;LangSmith: accountability not just observability (tamper-evident chains, not mutable logs), content stays on your infra (prompts&#x2F;completions go to your S3&#x2F;MinIO), compliance built-in (22 auto-evaluated controls mapped to SOC 2 and ISO 27001), and deterministic replay to reproduce any AI decision.\nPython SDK integrates with OpenAI, LangChain, and CrewAI in 3 lines: pip install air-blackbox-sdk\nEverything is Apache-2.0. CI runs on every push. 200+ tests across all repos.\nI&#x27;m not a traditional dev — I&#x27;m a store owner who got frustrated enough with AI accountability gaps to build the tooling myself.

After 2-3 page navigations your context window is gone. Firecrawl and Jina Reader are better on token count but they convert to markdown, so you can read but not interact. No clicking, no typing, no form filling.<p>PageMap takes a different approach. It runs a 5-stage HTML pruning pipeline and a 3-tier interactive element detector (ARIA roles, implicit HTML roles, CDP event listeners). The output is a structured map with numbered refs that an agent can act on.<p>I ran a benchmark across 66 tasks on 9 e-commerce sites. PageMap got 95.2% task success at $0.58 total. Firecrawl got 60.9% at $2.66. Jina Reader got 61.2% at $1.54. The gap mostly comes from PageMap being the only one that supports interaction and from the pruning keeping relevant content while cutting noise.<p>It works as an MCP server with three tools. get_page_map navigates to a URL and returns the compressed map. execute_action clicks, types, or selects by ref number. get_page_state is a lightweight status check.<p><pre><code>    pip install retio-pagemap\n    playwright install chromium\n</code></pre>\nAdd to .mcp.json and it works with Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client.<p>Python, Playwright, lxml.

      "body": "I&#x27;m a CS professor at an undergraduate college. I&#x27;m currently teaching a class on AI coding for non-programmers and also using Claude Code for all the projects in my upper level courses. I&#x27;m also planning to update our first course in the fall to include an intro to agentic programming.<p>Here are some practical suggestions based on what I&#x27;ve seen with my students. To summarize: AI programming de-emphasizes the specifics of languages and frameworks but rewards having a good knowledge of systems and a careful, structured development process.<p>1. Do learn some by-hand programming in a standard language like Python. Even if you aren&#x27;t looking at the AI-generated code, this will teach you the building blocks of software design - things like functions, classes, files, and data types - which will help you design more complex applications. The ability to look at a program and reason about what it&#x27;s doing is a key skill.<p>2. The terminal environment if you aren&#x27;t already using it. This will unlock additional levels of control and help you understand how agents use tools.<p>3. Architecture of the applications you&#x27;re creating. If you&#x27;re making web apps, for example, learn about the front-end and back-end, how they exchange information, how a back-end database works, etc. The key is not the low-level details of those things, but how an application is divided into parts that exchange data with each other. This knowledge helps you move from a general concept for an application to an actual design.<p>4. Related to that point: the concept of encapsulation in software design. This is the idea that each part of your system should be self-contained and exchange information with other parts through a well-defined interface. If a component is encapsulated, you can change its internal details without messing with the rest of the system. This is important for AI, because it allows you to carefully control the targets of your generations.<p>5",

When a generator creates an image, a 3-layer signature (SHA-256 + PDQ perceptual hash + CLIP ViT-L&#x2F;14 embedding) is registered in a central index. Anyone can verify an image by querying the index. The signature survives any transformation because it&#x27;s not embedded in the file. Think Shazam for images, but for provenance.<p>Matching pipeline: exact hash lookup → CLIP cosine similarity via Qdrant HNSW (sub-10ms at billions) → PDQ hamming distance enrichment.<p>Only verified AI generators can mint. Verification is open.<p>Early MVP. Looking for feedback on the protocol design and poking holes in the approach.",

The background tasks would show up on the UI once it is scheduled by the assistant. However, you might have to connect the necessary MCP tools in your case.<p>On Gmail actions - we currently don’t take write actions on inboxes like archiving or categorizing emails. The Google connection is read-only and used purely to build the knowledge graph. We’re working on adding write actions, but we’re being careful about how we implement them. Also probably why the agent was confused and was looking for an MCP to accomplish the same job.<p>On noise in the knowledge graph — this is something we’re actively tuning. We currently have different note-strictness levels that auto-inferred based on the inbox volume (configurable in ~&#x2F;.rowboat&#x2F;config&#x2F;note-creation.json) that control what qualifies as a new node. Higher strictness prevents most emails from creating new entities and instead only updates existing ones. That said, this needs to be surfaced in the product and better calibrated.

And install.  And install.  And install ... FOR HOURS!  WTF IS IT DOING!  The target machine is a smoking AMD desktop with SSD and a gigantic amount of pre-shortage RAM on fibre.

Vanadium does disable third party cookies but that doesn&#x27;t really do as much as you&#x27;d think because the way third party cookies are defined and what disabling them means is not intuitive. Third party cookies would not be a significant issue if cookies were fully partitioned by the top level site. Chromium has implemented state partitioning for the vast majority of the state but specifically not cookies by default where it&#x27;s opt-in, so we need to handle that ourselves. They do support partitioned cookies but it&#x27;s opt-in. Strictly partitioning cookies breaks a lot of cross-site functionality so no mainstream browser is doing it but rather they use heuristics to support cases like cross-site login and their partitioning is easy to bypass through that.",

Sometimes small local apps are better served by a save file and they save file might as well have an extensible format that I can update as I go.

They (sometimes rightfully) do not trust to the private sector&#x27;s biased explanation that this vulnerabililty has been &quot;fixed&quot; and sometimes effectively prevent public disclosures about the event, allowing only the affected data subjects to be informed about the event. The potential danger of re-exploitation and protection of the public far outweighs the public&#x27;s (that is persons who are not affected by this breach) right to be informed of such event.

People also don&#x27;t understand that many articles would have to be priced at 20-50 cents, even more, to be worth it, or there should be an issue pass with the actual price of the whole issue.<p>- the publishing industry being a mess, hard to coordinate as everyone wants to do their own thing, and early experiments failing, ruining the reputation of the idea itself. Many people say micropayments are something that needs a good time, but nobody knows when that time will come.<p>- the huge fees that processors take (2% + 29 cents), meaning we needed to load into a wallet a minimum of 5$.
