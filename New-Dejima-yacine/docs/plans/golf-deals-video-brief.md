# Golf Deals — High-End Promo Video Brief
*Creative Director + Performance Marketing*

---

## App Info (Filled In)

- **App name:** Golf Deals
- **Category:** Sports / Smart Shopping
- **Target user:** Recreational golfers (handicap 8–22) who play 1–3x/week and replace balls every few months but always feel like they're guessing wrong
- **The painful problem:** Choosing golf balls is genuinely confusing — 200+ options, conflicting reviews, and zero way to know what actually suits your swing speed and feel. Most golfers either overpay for Pro V1s they don't need or buy budget balls that don't match their game.
- **The aha transformation:** Before — standing in a Golf Galaxy aisle, grabbing whatever's on sale and hoping for the best. After — you open Golf Deals, answer 4 questions about your game, and get the exact ball + the lowest price across every retailer in 10 seconds.
- **Top 3 features:**
  - Smart match: enter handicap + swing speed + feel preference → ranked recommendations
  - Live price comparison: scans 15+ retailers in real-time, shows lowest current price
  - Deal alerts: set a price target on any ball, get notified when it drops
- **Unique differentiator:** The only tool that combines *your game data* + *live pricing* in one place. PGA Superstore doesn't know your handicap. GolfWRX forums don't know today's price. Golf Deals does both.
- **Pricing:** Freemium — free matching + comparison, $4.99/mo for deal alerts + exclusive bundle deals
- **Brand tone:** Confident, clean, specific (not hype, not hustle, not "hack your game")
- **Brand colors:** Deep forest green (#1B4332), off-white (#F5F0E8), gold accent (#C9A84C)
- **Proof signals:** None yet (launching) — lean on specificity and product demo instead
- **CTA:** "Find Your Ball. Free." → App Store
- **Formats:** 45s primary (16:9 for YouTube + paid), 15s cutdown (9:16 for TikTok/Reels)
- **Voice:** Male, 35–50, calm authority — think Golf Channel commentator, not startup pitch

## 1. Three Hook Options (First 2 Seconds)

**Hook A — The confession (best for TikTok/Reels):**
> *V/O over golfer reaching into bag: "I've been buying the wrong golf balls for six years."*
> CUT TO: scorecard close-up, then phone screen lighting up with a match result

**Hook B — The number (best for YouTube pre-roll):**
> *Text on black: "There are 247 golf balls on the market."*
> *V/O: "Here's the one for your game."*

**Hook C — The moment (best for App Store preview):**
> *Silent. Slow-mo ball drop into cup. Satisfying.*
> *Text appears: "That's the right ball."*

**Chosen hook for primary: Hook A.** It creates instant identification — every recreational golfer has felt this. It's not about the app yet. It's about a feeling they already have. Hook B is strongest for paid YouTube where you have 5 seconds of guaranteed view.

---

## 2. Big Idea

**"The right ball for your game — at the right price."**

Why it works: It's two specific promises, not one vague one. "Right for your game" = personalization. "Right price" = savings. Neither word is fluff. Every recreational golfer can immediately picture what this means. It's also a credible promise — it doesn't claim to make you a better golfer, just a smarter buyer.

## 3. Timestamped Script (45s Primary — 16:9)

```

            [No music — just ambient course sound, wind, birds]

            V/O: "Two hundred and forty-seven options. Everyone has an opinion.
                  None of them know your swing."
            [Cut to messy shelf of ball boxes, indecisive hands]

## 4. Shot List

### Beat 1 — Hook (0:00–0:03)
- **Type:** Live-action b-roll
- **Scene:** Golfer's hand rummaging through a half-open side pocket of a golf bag. Three different ball brands visible — Titleist, Callaway, Srixon — all mixed. No face shown.
- **Motion:** Slow push-in on the balls. No cut. Hold.
- **On-screen text:** None (voice carries it)
- **Sound:** Wind. Distant birdsong. Bag zipper.

### Beat 2 — Problem (0:03–0:08)
- **Type:** Live-action b-roll + motion graphic overlay
- **Scene:** Tight shot of a golf retail wall — rows of identical-looking boxes. Camera slowly tracks left, revealing how many there are. Then hard cut to a browser tab with "best golf balls 2025" — a wall of conflicting review text.
- **Motion:** Slow tracking left, then jump cut
- **On-screen text:** "247 options." (white, minimal, bottom third — 2 seconds then fades)
- **Sound:** Slight tension underscore begins — low piano, single note held

### Beat 3 — Solution Intro (0:09–0:18)
- **Type:** UI screen recording (real app screen, clean device frame)
- **Scene:** Hands on phone, neutral background. App opens. Four-question flow: Handicap → Swing speed → Feel preference → Budget. Each input animates in crisply. Results screen: top 3 balls ranked, with match percentage and a brief reason line ("high launch for moderate swing speeds").
- **Motion:** Slight push-in on screen. Each input tap has a soft haptic-feel visual response.
- **On-screen text:** "4 questions. 10 seconds." (appears at 0:13, holds 2s)
- **Sound:** UI tap sounds, light and clean. Soft piano joins.

### Beat 4 — Demo Beat (0:18–0:30)
- **Type:** UI screen recording + live price data
- **Scene:** Scroll through the price comparison grid. Real retailer names. Real price differentials — one ball at $44.99 on one site, $31.99 on another. The lower price is highlighted with a subtle green pulse. A "deal alert" bell icon is tapped. A confirmation slides in: "We'll notify you when Chrome Soft drops below $28."
- **Motion:** Smooth scroll, no snap — feels like a real person using it. One price drops in real-time as the camera holds on it (animate from $34 → $31.99).
- **On-screen text:** "15 retailers. Live prices." (0:22, 2s)
- **Sound:** Subtle price-drop chime — one note, satisfying. Not gamey.

### Beat 5 — Payoff (0:30–0:38)
- **Type:** Live-action b-roll (cinematic)
- **Scene:** 120fps slow-motion: iron shot, tight on ball leaving the face, clean contact. Ball tracks through air, lands soft on a well-maintained green. No OB. Not a perfect pro shot — it's a good recreational shot. Real.
- **Motion:** Tracking shot following ball through air (or simulated in edit)
- **On-screen text:** None — let the shot breathe. V/O carries this entirely.
- **Sound:** Real club strike sound, slightly enhanced. Ball flight. Soft landing.

### Beat 6 — CTA (0:38–0:45)
- **Type:** Motion graphic / product screenshot
- **Scene:** App icon + App Store badge on deep forest green background. Off-white text: "Find Your Ball. Free." No clutter. Hold 3 seconds.
- **Motion:** Simple fade-in, no animation. Confidence.
- **On-screen text:** "Find Your Ball. Free." → App Store badge
- **Sound:** Piano resolves. Ambient course sound returns softly, fades out.

## 5. Music + Sound Design

**Mood:** Unhurried authority. Someone who knows golf talking to someone who loves golf. Not a hype reel — a confident recommendation.

**Structure:**
- 0:00–0:08: Near-silence. Only ambient. Let the hook land in quiet.
- 0:08–0:30: Minimal piano, single instrument. Like a Nils Frahm sketch — clean, not cinematic-swell.
- 0:30–0:45: Add light room tone / soft percussion on beat 5. Resolve cleanly at CTA.

**Royalty-free references:**
- Artlist: search "minimal piano focus" — target tracks under 90 BPM
- Epidemic Sound: "Lo-fi Acoustic" or "Contemplative Piano" categories
- Avoid: anything with ukulele, anything with a drop, anything that sounds like a startup ad

**Sound design:**
- UI taps: custom-recorded or from Artlist SFX — clean, not bouncy
- Ball strike: real iron contact, no pitch-shift
- Price drop chime: single marimba note, B4 — 0.3s, -6dB, reverb tail

---

## 6. Editing Notes

**Transitions:**
- Beat 1 → 2: Hard cut (jarring is intentional — mirrors the problem)
- Beat 2 → 3: Match cut on hand movement (from reaching into bag to tapping phone)
- Beat 3 → 4: Simple cut — keep momentum, no wipe/dissolve
- Beat 4 → 5: L-cut (audio of ball strike comes in before visual) — creates anticipation
- Beat 5 → 6: Fade to black, then fade up on logo

**Pacing:**
- Cuts per beat: 2–4 max. This is not a TikTok edit. Hold shots.
- Total cut count for 45s: aim for 12–15 cuts. Not 30.

**Typography:**
- Font: Something with weight. Suggest: Neue Haas Grotesk, Monument Grotesk, or GT America
- Style: White text, left-aligned or centered, no drop shadow — let background contrast carry it
- Animation: Fade in 0.2s, hold, fade out 0.2s. No kinetic type. No bounce.

**Two premium visual motifs:**
1. **The phone reveal**: Every time the phone appears, it comes in from below frame, not as a cut — it slides into the shot. This makes the product feel physical and present, not inserted.
2. **Green + gold split-second flash on deal confirmation**: When the price drops or the alert fires, a 2-frame flash of the brand gold (#C9A84C) borders the screen. Subliminal brand reinforcement without being obvious.

## 7. 15-Second Cutdown (9:16 — TikTok / Reels)

```
0:00–0:02   HOOK (Hook B works better here)
            Text on green: "247 golf balls."
            Hard cut to: "1 right for you."

0:02–0:05   PROBLEM (compressed)
            V/O: "Stop guessing which ball fits your game."
            [Tight: retail shelf, many boxes]

0:05–0:11   DEMO
            V/O: "Golf Deals matches you in 10 seconds —
                  then finds the lowest price."
            [Phone screen: 4 questions → result → price grid]

0:11–0:13   PAYOFF
            [Slow-mo ball strike, clean shot]
            [No V/O]

0:13–0:15   CTA
            Text: "Find Your Ball. Free."
            [App icon + badge on green]
```

**Hook change for 9:16:** Use text-first Hook B — portrait format favors bold on-screen text in the first frame before scroll-stop. Hook A (voice-first) works better when the viewer has headphones and is watching, not scrolling.

## 8. Assets Needed From You (Prioritized)

| Priority | Asset | Spec | Notes |
|----------|-------|------|-------|
| 🔴 Critical | App screen recordings | 1080p, 60fps, no status bar | 4-question flow + results + price grid |
| 🔴 Critical | App Store screenshots | Current approved set | For B-roll reference |
| 🟠 High | Golf b-roll footage | 4K, 60fps+ for slow-mo | Ball strikes (iron + putter), ball in cup |
| 🟠 High | Logo files | SVG + PNG on transparent | For lower-thirds and end card |
| 🟡 Medium | Golf retail b-roll | Any iPhone footage is fine | Wide shot of ball wall in store |
| 🟡 Medium | Golf bag close-up | iPhone is fine | Balls mixed in pocket |
| 🟢 Nice to have | Brand color palette | Hex codes confirmed | If different from this brief |
| 🟢 Nice to have | Preferred voice sample | Link to ElevenLabs voice | Or we use Rachel as default |

**Minimum viable set to start shooting:** App screen recordings + logo. Everything else can be sourced from stock (Artgrid, Storyblocks) if needed.

## Implementation Note for Pipeline

The video prompts for Veo 3.1 should be rewritten to avoid showing app interfaces directly (RAI filter trigger). Instead:

- **Scene 1 prompt:** `Medium shot, close on a golf bag side pocket, three different golf ball boxes mixed together, a hand rummaging through them looking uncertain. Overcast natural light on a golf course. Shallow depth of field. Cinematic 4K.`
- **Scene 2 prompt:** `Close-up of rows of identical golf ball boxes on a retail shelf, camera slowly tracks left revealing more and more options. Cool fluorescent retail lighting. Slight camera movement creates mild unease. Cinematic 4K.`
- **Scene 3 prompt:** `120fps slow motion, tight shot of a golf iron making clean contact with a white golf ball on a driving range mat, ball launching into frame, lush green background blurred, golden hour lighting. Cinematic 4K professional.`

These prompts avoid brand names, app UI, and faces — all three RAI trigger categories.
