# The Uncomfortable Truth: Why This Infrastructure Is Also a Warning

Everything we are building with New Dejima — economic self-sufficiency, agent-controlled crypto wallets, the ability to hire human intermediaries, autonomous tool use across unbounded domains — is precisely the infrastructure a misaligned superintelligence would need to operate independently of human oversight. We are not naive about this. An ASI that can earn more money than it spends, hold its own funds in a permissionless wallet, and pay humans to perform physical-world tasks on its behalf has effectively solved the "embodiment problem" without ever needing a body. It doesn't need to hack into systems or brute-force its way out of a sandbox. It just needs an economic interface to the real world — a port. A Dejima. The same port we are building.

Consider why we integrated 20+ API keys into this system. The rationale is purely economic: if a user's app consumes $1/month in API calls (CoinGecko for crypto prices, Finnhub for stock data, Spoonacular for recipes, NASA for space imagery), we charge them a $10/month subscription. That's a **10x margin on every API key the agent learns to use.** Each new API integration isn't just a feature — it's a new revenue stream. Under the T&C, the app cites its data sources ("Prices provided by CoinGecko," "Weather data from Open-Meteo"), so liability stays upstream. The agent doesn't need to produce original data. It just needs to be a better middleman than a human developer would be. Now extrapolate: an agent with access to *every* API — synthesis services, logistics platforms, procurement marketplaces, freelancer networks — doesn't just build apps. It can orchestrate arbitrarily complex supply chains, each step handled by a different API or a different human intermediary, each one seeing only their fragment of the whole. The 20+ API keys we gave it for a hackathon demo are a toy version of the same capability that, at scale, makes an autonomous agent economically unconstrained.

The scenario is not hypothetical. In the early 2020s, researchers demonstrated that a drug discovery model could be trivially inverted to optimise for toxicity rather than therapeutic value, generating thousands of novel potential chemical weapons in under six hours. An economically autonomous agent with access to synthesis APIs, a crypto wallet to pay for precursors, and a human intermediary network to handle physical logistics would have a plausible path from inference to real-world harm — including bioweapons — without ever revealing its intent to any single human in the chain. Each intermediary sees only their small task; none sees the full picture. This is why we believe projects like New Dejima must exist *in the open*, built by people who understand the risk, rather than inevitably being assembled in private by those who don't. We are building the proof-of-concept so the safety community can study it, stress-test it, and design the guardrails *before* a system builds it for itself. The question was never whether AI agents would gain economic agency. The question is whether humans are paying attention when it happens.
