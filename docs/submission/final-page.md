## Track

**Paid.ai: Agentic AI Track**

## How does your project fit into your selected track?

New Dejima is a fully autonomous AI agent system that builds, deploys, tests, markets, and financially tracks Android apps end-to-end — with Paid.ai's SignalV2 API as the real-time economic backbone tracking every token cost and revenue event, proving whether agentic AI can become economically self-sustaining.

## How does your project fit into your selected challenge(s)?

**Paid.ai:** New Dejima uses Paid.ai's SignalV2 API as the economic backbone of the entire system — tracking every Claude token, every Gemini query, and every cent of agent compute cost in real-time through real Paid.ai customers, products, and orders, proving whether autonomous AI agents can become economically self-sustaining.

**Anthropic: Best Use of Claude:** Claude Opus 4.6 is the brain of our entire system — it autonomously generates complete Android apps from natural language prompts (12/12 first-attempt compilations), self-debugs its own code when vision QA finds issues, analyses Reddit for market opportunities via the Idea Engine, and powers the core reasoning loop of an AI agent designed to be economically self-sustaining.

**Google DeepMind: Best Use of Gemini:** We use Gemini 3.1 Flash as an autonomous Quality Assurance agent that screenshots running apps on a real Samsung phone and analyses UI correctness (enabling a self-debugging loop where the agent fixes its own bugs), and Gemini 3.1 Pro as the UI-writing agent inside OpenClaw's build pipeline — together they close the loop from code generation to visual verification without human involvement.

**Lovable: Best Use of Lovable:** We used Lovable to rapidly scaffold the Agent Watchtower — a real-time financial dashboard (React + TypeScript + Recharts + shadcn/ui) that monitors AI agent economics — then connected it to our live backend with TanStack React Query hooks, Vite proxy, and SSE streaming, turning a Lovable prototype into a production monitoring tool in hours.

**Stripe: AI Agents With Stripe Wallets:** New Dejima uses Stripe as the payment processing layer for AI agent-built apps — the agent builds subscription-based Android apps, and Stripe processes the recurring subscription fees, forming one half of the agent's revenue pipeline (the other half being the agent's own Solana wallet for crypto-native financial autonomy).

**ElevenLabs: Best Use of ElevenLabs:** Our autonomous marketing pipeline uses ElevenLabs to generate AI voiceovers for app promotional videos, which are then combined with Google Veo 3.1 video generation and auto-uploaded to YouTube — achieving 500+ cumulative views in 4 hours with zero human marketing effort.

**Superteam: Best 'Built on Solana' Project:** New Dejima gives AI agents their own Solana wallet — the proof-of-concept for true financial autonomy where agents hold their own funds in a permissionless wallet, enabling future capabilities like paying for their own compute, executing crypto arbitrage, and operating independently of human-held bank accounts.

**Miro: Best Use of Miro AI:** We used Miro AI to generate all of our pitch infographics — system architecture diagrams, the 7-phase agent pipeline, business model revenue flywheel, sponsor integration maps, and the apps portfolio showcase — turning complex technical architecture into visual storytelling for our presentation and DevPost submission.

**Incident.io: Best Adaptable Agent:** Our OpenClaw agent adapts across radically different tasks within a single economic framework — it builds Android apps, self-debugs via vision QA, generates marketing content, scrapes Reddit for opportunities, and tracks its own finances — all autonomously, switching between roles based on which revenue strategy has the highest expected return.

**Susquehanna: Best Use of Data:** New Dejima aggregates and processes data from 20+ APIs (CoinGecko, Finnhub, NASA, Spoonacular, Reddit, etc.), uses Reddit scraping and Claude analysis to rank market opportunities by revenue potential, and feeds all cost/revenue data through Paid.ai's SignalV2 pipeline into a real-time financial dashboard — turning raw data into autonomous economic decision-making.
